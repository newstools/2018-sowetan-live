Family outside the courtroom told TshisaLIVE they had no idea how they would raise the additional R30‚000. Brickz was found guilty of raping a relative and was sentenced to 15 years in prison by Baloyi last year. In March Brickz told the court he understood there was a concern he would abscond‚ but he had no intention of running away. He has always maintained his innocence and has said the "truth will come out." "I have made an oath to myself that I will bring myself to this court to make sure that this matter comes to an end‚ so that it also brings me closure. I don't see how it will be so easy for me to just decide to abscond when I'm getting much closer to the truth." He has also been taking courses in prison. "I've taken each and every course that has come way in prison in a mission to better myself."
