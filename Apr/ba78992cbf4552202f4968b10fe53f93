This was followed by another confirmation from arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa, who honoured Akhumzi for his "exhilarating energy, passion and appreciation of Africa culture." Police spokesperson Captain Namhla Mdleleni, the accident claimed five lives happened on the N6 near Queenstown in the early hours of Saturday morning.
