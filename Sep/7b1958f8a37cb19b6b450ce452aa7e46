Zakhele Mazibuko‚ from the Inkatha Freedom Party’s uThukela district‚ was killed in an ambush on Saturday night‚ the IFP confirmed on Sunday. The district’s publicity secretary was attacked between Estcourt and Colenso‚ shortly after leaving a party meeting‚ said Mkhuleko Hlengwa‚ the IFP’s national spokesperson. “Heartfelt condolences to the family. #SilenceTheGuns‚” Hlengwa tweeted. The details of the killings are still sketchy. Hlengwa said more details would be released at a later date.
