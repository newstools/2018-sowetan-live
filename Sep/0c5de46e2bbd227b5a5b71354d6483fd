Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has reached a deal with the Spanish tax authorities to serve one year in prison in a tax evasion case, El Mundo newspaper reported on Tuesday. Mourinho is unlikely to serve any time in jail under the deal because Spanish law states that a sentence of under two years for a first offence can be served on probation. The Spanish tax agency was not immediately available for comment.
