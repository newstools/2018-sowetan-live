Veteran music producer Chicco Twala has slammed allegations that it was his gun that was used to kill former Bafana Bafana goalkeeper‚ Senzo Meyiwa. Parody account @AdvBarryRoux caused a frenzy over the weekend after tweeting so-called "information" about the case‚ which again pointed fingers towards Chicco and his son‚ Longwe. The account has not been verified and is considered to produce fake news. It's not the first time the claims have been made about Chicco and Longwe‚ with many‚ including Senzo's father Sam‚ insisting there has been a cover-up by those who were in the house on the night the soccer star was murdered. Chicco has now broken his silence‚ insisting that his gun is always with him. He spoke to Masechaba Ndlovu and Moflava on Metro FM. "It wasn't missing. My firearm is always with me.

He said he handed it in for ballistics tests and it was later returned. "They took my firearm and about four weeks later they said my gun is not the one." In an interview on Monday on Metro FM Sam Meyiwa again insisted that there had been a cover-up. "The people who were present when my son was shot are causing me so much pain. They know who killed Senzo but they are keeping quiet. Senzo was a breadwinner. He supported the family and now we are suffering‚"
