That Mamelodi Sundowns star Percy Tau is destined for Europe is undeniable, but the question ought to shift from being less about when and to more about where. At 23, Tau is a fully-fledged Bafana Bafana international and has shone the brightest in the star-studded Sundowns squad. His preternatural abilities on the football field leave spectators awestruck and defenders bewildered. Earlier in the week the Sowetan reported that Sundowns had received a R18-million bid for Tau from FC Rostov of Russia, while FC Midtjylland of Denmark have tabled a written offer. It has been many years since the country had a solid representation of players in the top leagues of the world, including the English Premiership, Spanish La Liga, the German Bundesliga, the Italian Serie A and the French Ligue 1. Tau's former teammate Keagan Dolly plays for Montpellier in Ligue 1, but the winger has not cemented a regular place in the starting XI. Bongani Zungu on the other hand plays for lowly SC Amiens. Sundowns striker Jeremy Brockie says Tau has a bright future ahead of him and is easily the best player in the Premiership. "Percy is just top class, it's a pleasure to be with him in training everyday," the New Zealand international told Sowetan. "He has all the attributes of a player who can achieve success at the highest level. I think one day he can definitely go to Europe. "Coach Pitso [Mosimane] has just been working with him and wants to make sure he is a more complete player. "I look forward to play with him in attack." Tau will look to continue his fine form when the Brazilians face Cape Town City tomorrow (8pm) in a top-of-the-table Absa Premiership clash.
