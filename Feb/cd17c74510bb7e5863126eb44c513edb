Two dramatic shootouts between tactical police units and suspected cash-in-transit robbers left as many as nine men dead in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday. It is understood that six alleged CIT robbers were killed during an exchange of fire with police on the R617 – which runs between Boston and Bulwer in the KZN Midlands - on Monday morning. Later‚ police intercepted a vehicle travelling on the N3 near the Mariannhill Toll Plaza. Three men were killed and a fourth was injured. Sources with knowledge of the incident said that officers had intercepted a group of men as they were travelling in the vicinity of Underberg. The second shooting‚ they said‚ was a group of suspected robbers which had been part of the first gang and had fled. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that there had been “an incident” but was not able to provide further detail. This is a developing story.
