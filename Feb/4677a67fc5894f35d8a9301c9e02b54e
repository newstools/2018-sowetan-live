The men were arrested on Monday following the discovery of the body of the woman‚ whose head was missing. Police said Ishmael Mopai‚ 28‚ and his elder brother‚ Michael‚ 31‚ from Matiko-Xikaya village near Phalaborwa‚ were facing charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice.

Spokesman for the police Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the victim's head was recovered in the nearby bushes.
