It's business as usual at SuperSport United despite the fact the club is yet to confirm their new head coach for the 2018/19 season. Matsatsantsa have been in camp in Polokwane, Limpopo, over the past few days and the man in charge, Kaitano Tembo, says he's focused on the job at hand. "Well, for me it's just business as usual and I don't think that matters. It's not important to me," insisted Tembo, who's been in the caretaker role since Eric Tinkler resigned early in March. The Zimbabwean mentor is apparently favoured by management to take over on a permanent basis considering his long-service with the Tshwane club. Tembo has been with SuperSport for 19 years from his playing days. From a player's perspective, he has the backing of captain and midfielder Dean Furman. "It's really been great working with coach Kaitano. He's been with us for a long time and he knows the players inside and out. He knows what makes us tick and he knows how to get us going when we are not ticking. "I think we saw last season when he came in and he did a fantastic job. He helped turn our season around and everyone is enjoying their training now. The vibe in the dressing room is really, really good and of course that's been built up over a few years that we've been together. "Coach Kaitano has been there every step of the way, so now that he's in charge we are fully behind him," said the Bafana Bafana international. SuperSport will start their 2018/19 campaign away to Cape Town City on August 5.
