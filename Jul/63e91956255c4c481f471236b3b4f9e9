It is very strange to see what Ajax Cape Town have gone through due to the Tendai Ndoro saga. The South African Football Association (Safa) and the Premier Soccer League (PSL) need to explain this to the soccer-loving nation. Well, we all agree that Ajax fielded a defaulter in Ndoro and the matter was referred to Fifa whereby it was sent back to Safa. Both Safa and the PSL should have taken a decisive decision earlier but they didn't because the outcome would have meant that Orlando Pirates, who trailed Mamelodi Sundowns by one or two points at the time, would benefit three points from this issue, which would have had a huge influence on the league winner. From where we stand now, the fact of the matter is that Ndoro featured for three clubs, which are Pirates, Saudi Arabian outfit Al Faisaly as well as the Urban Warriors in 2017/18, hence the docking of points and awarding them to the opposing teams in the games that Ndoro featured for Ajax in the period in question. However, Pirates lost interest in the saga after falling way behind Sundowns. In all fairness, Ajax deserve a fair judgment, because if those points were docked earlier maybe they could have fought harder to avoid relegation.
