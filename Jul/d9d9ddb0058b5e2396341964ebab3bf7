About 380 babies and 16 mothers have died at a Limpopo hospital in less than three years, apparently as a result of traditional remedies meant to induce and hasten childbirth. According to management at the Dilokong Hospital in Driekop outside Burgersfort, pregnant women are drinking a variety of concoctions which they either buy from traditional healers or make at home resulting in ruptured wombs and death. One of the most common mixtures is called “Makgorometsa”, loosely translated it means ‘to push’. Traditional healer Francina Kwete believes the incorrect use of the herb is the problem.
