For Zimbabwean national Bright Madaya, today's election in his country will in the future determine whether he will return to SA or not. Like many Zimbabweans who made their way to the country through Beitbridge border post in Musina, Limpopo, at the weekend, Madaya is hoping for a change and strong economy that will create jobs, development and eradicate abject poverty in his country. Madaya, who hails from Nyanga, came to SA in 2003 for job opportunities. "I'm going home to vote for change. We need presidential change and we are going to give young leaders a chance to lead. "I have been working as a construction worker in Germiston [Ekurhuleni] while I'm a qualified teacher. Zanu-PF has done nothing for the people of Zimbabwe. If Zanu-PF is out we are guaranteed a better future," Madaya said. He said he believed that MDC leader Nelson Chamisa will bring about change in the country. Chamisa is touted as the toughest opposition leader to Zanu-PF and Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Wellington Majengwa from Masvingo said he was looking forward to casting his vote for MDC. "Mnangagwa has been part of the problem for the past 37 years and there is nothing he can do for us. We are going to give Chamisa a landslide victory," Majengwa said.
