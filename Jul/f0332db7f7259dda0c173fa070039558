Meet the man who has stolen former public protector Thuli Madonsela's heart. Dick Foxton, pictured, a veteran PR consultant, got engaged to the academic recently. There has been much speculation following Madonsela's revelation on SABC3's Real Talk early this week that she is engaged. She refused to reveal the identity of her partner. But Sowetan has it on good authority that it is Foxton, whose clients have included mining houses, banks, car manufacturers as well as individual political figures. When asked to confirm, Foxton refused to comment. Sources close to the matter yesterday confirmed that Foxton was Madonsela's lover, adding that it was an open secret among their family and friends.
