A former ANC employee allegedly implicated in three cash-in-transit heists is expected to apply for bail in the Roodepoort Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Errol Velile Present was one of four people arrested following a heist in Dobsonville, Soweto earlier this month. All four were charged with armed robbery and possession of hijacked motor vehicles. The accused were arrested on July 6 and 7. Four hijacked vehicles were recovered, two of which were apparently used in a heist outside Capitec Bank in Elias Motsoaledi Road in Soweto earlier this month. Present is no stranger to controversy, the Sunday Times linked him to a controversial farm deal in Limpopo. The Sunday Times reported that then minister of land reform Gugile Nkwinti introduced Present as, a Luthuli House comrade who was “shopping” for a thriving farm in Limpopo, to one of his top officials at a land summit. Just eight months after the meeting‚ Bekendvlei Farm was bought for R97-million and handed over to Present‚ who had been working at ANC headquarters Luthuli House for more than 10 years‚ and his partner‚ businessman Moses Boshomane‚ to manage. A senior departmental official had prioritised the deal by bypassing required procedures. A day after the deal went through‚ Nkwinti was the speaker at Present’s lavish wedding. Neither Present nor Boshomane had an ancestral claim to the farm. They also had no agricultural experience‚ the newspaper reported. In a statement on July 18 announcing that it had fired Present‚ the ANC said: “The ANC expects from its members and employees to respect the laws of the land and not be involved in any criminal activity.”
