Braamfontein is known for its cool, kitschy food spots and retailers. One of the establishments that embodies these cool qualities is Calexico Restaurant and Vinyl Lounge. Its bright-yellow metal chairs and palm frond-patterned seats on the deck and impressive fireplace, are some of the things that ensure this place have a vibe. The walls are stacked with records ranging from Bob Marley and The Wailer’s Legend to Beck’s Modern Guilt. There’s even wall art in the form of neon sign-worded Real Music Never Gets Old. It’s a perfect place to spend a chilled Saturday afternoon. The newly launched spot boasts some impressive American-style cuisine. Their menu was designed and created by consulting chef Robyn Timson-Moss. There’s something for everyone - there are gluten-free, vegetarian and meat dishes. The standouts are mushroom skewers and sticky free-range smoked ribs with homemade BBQ sauce. For dessert, the chocolate brownies and homemade apple pie with halva ice cream are recommended.   The Calexico team and resident chef Cecelia Hobyani pride themselves in delivering the best. SowetanLIVE had the opportunity to meet them when we spent the afternoon at the restaurant creating one of their new dishes. We got to experiment with creating a Artichoke and Jalapeño dip with TV personality Blue Mbombo. The dish is served with nachos. The end result was a crunchy, creamy yet spicy flavour explosion. Definitely one of those dishes diners should try out.  We also had a taste of their barbeque chicken wings served with a blue cheese sauce, which was simply divine. *Visit Calexico from Tuesday to Thursday from 10.30am to 10.30pm; Friday from 9.30am to 12 midnight; Saturday from 9.30am to 10.30pm; and Sunday from 10am to 6.30pm.
