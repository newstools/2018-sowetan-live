The upcoming boxing tournament to be jointly organised by Jeff Ellis and Rodney Berman at Emperors Palace on August 10 is no ordinary fistic night. The box-and-dine event, dubbed "Reach for the Stars", will help children diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses. Ellis and Berman - who have quietly come to the aid of many people including former South African and world boxing champions - will raise funds for the Reach For A Dream Foundation. Female boxing promoter Shereen Hunter said she approached Ellis about the idea of being involved in this noble initiative, and Ellis did not hesitate. "Jeff and Rodney went one step [further] by saying they will raise money for the foundation," said Hunter. Renson "Bagdad" Hobyane and Rowan Campbell will top the boxing programme with a 12-rounder for the vacant South African super middleweight title. - Bongani Magasela
