Come Clean Gear up for washday with a superb shampooing routine. Your hair will thank you Four ways to care for your hair Thomas Tseola, a hair expert at Darling Hair, shares care tips for healthier hair, from treatments to shampoo Go for a treatment, especially before putting on a new set of braids, as this will help with overall health of the hair and scalp. It is wise to use a moisturising treatment for the scalp to replenish moisture, oils and nutrients often lost when hair is braided because the scalp is exposed to the elements. This also helps prevent itchiness and flaking of the scalp. Try: Argan Oil Hair Treatment Make sure to shampoo with a hydrating product and lukewarm water once every second week, even when you're wearing braids. A hydrating shampoo not only cleanses the hair and scalp but is gentle and will not leave your hair and scalp feeling coarse and dry. Try: Carrol's Daughter Rhassoul Clay Sulfate-Free Shampoo Moisturise your hair and scalp with a good conditioning spray or serum at least two or three times a week. If you've been using moisturising hair food or braid spray more than you're meant to, and end up with product build-up, flaking and itchiness, shampoo your hair instead of scraping it off. Try: Mizani Scalp Care Cooling When deep conditioning is done correctly, it will be easier to create attractive styles with your braids. Try: Ladine Hair Softener. After you've taken your extensions out, deep-condition your hair to restore the moisture that was lost when you had hair extensions in; this will also replenish your hair and scalp in time for your next braiding session.
