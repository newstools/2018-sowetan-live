Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has today accepted the resignation of MEC of Sports, Arts and Culture Onicca Moloi with immediate effect. Moloi resigned last week on her social media page after failing to make it in the provincial executive committee of the African National Congress. Mathabatha’s spokesman Kenny Mathivha said the premier has accepted the resignation of MEC Moloi with immediate effect. “The Premier therefore wishes to thank the MEC for the sterling performance she executed in the Department for the past few years she was a Member of the Executive Council.” “Although we wished her to stay longer, we wish her good luck in her future endeavours and hope she will perform her duties with the same energy she did when deployed in government”, said the Premier. The Premier has therefore appointed MEC for Treasury, Rob Tooley as acting MEC for Sport, Arts and Culture until such time the position is filled permanently. The acting position of MEC Charles Sekoati at the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has also not changed until such time the position is filled permanently.
