If there was ever an artist to trend three days straight, it had to be Emtee. The rapper had many a Twitter user shook during a performance where he was seen stumbling, slurring and eventually falling to fits of boos and laughter. Emtee denied allegations that he was drunk or high and let fans and haters know that he is fine and that things are peachy. Emtee has been the subject of much scrutiny from the public, from being the butt of the joke when his genitals were all over social media to his beefs with other rappers. The rapper will take the hot seat tonight opposite actress and TV personality, Pearl Thusi's show #BehindTheStory. Other than his beefs and nudes he will also discuss his relationship with Ambitious Recordz. Emtee is not the first celebrity to air out his dirty laundry on the current season of the show as many controversial artists and personalities have graced the screen to dissect their drama. Zodwa Wabantu bared it all and left Twitter users inspired after her interview, shots were fired by Denise Zimba during her episode where she criticised fellow TV personality Ayanda Thabethe while Jub Jub stole hearts when he shared that Kelly Khumalo has not allowed him to see his child since his release from prison.
