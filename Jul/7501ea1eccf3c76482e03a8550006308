The City of Ekurhuleni has launched a new mobile app aimed at improving service delivery in communities. The municipality said the app will make life easier for residents to report service-related queries, will allow residents to monitor the status of their queries and also to find service centres closest to where they live. The app was launched on Thursday at the Kathlehong customer care centre to relieve pressure on the council-run call centre that deals with service-delivery issues. City of Ekurhuleni chief information officer Tumelo Kganane said the app is convenient to use because it uses a satellite-based navigation system, GPS, to map out the city and its facilities. "It also has a search engine that can find all City forms that residents normally get from the website," said Kganane. The app provides on-the-spot reference numbers to the user immediately after reporting an incident, and also has a function to view the status of the logged calls. Residents also get a GPS location which means queries can only be logged on it while they are within Ekurhuleni. The app can also be used to report natural disasters, water and sanitation problems, roads and electricity-related problems. The City of Joburg, which launched its app in 2014, described this as "a great initiative for communities".
