Stokvels are a proud tradition that has always helped South Africans deal with rainy days. By saving a little every month, the communities in which we live always have cash available to look after our own in times of need. And what about the sunny days? Well, stokvels are the perfect way to save for those too. If you’ve ever dreamed of travelling overseas or pictured yourself on an exotic beach or visiting friends and family who are far away, then you need to start your own Flight Centre Stokvel Club. Besides getting exclusive Flight Centre discounts on travel, Stokvel club members also get free expert advice on how to achieve their travel dreams – all while being able to save gradually  in a safe, traditional stokvel ... without the need to apply for any credit. You can start a one-man club or run one with up to 30 members. Your members can contribute via EFT or debit order, or pay in cash at any Flight Centre branch. There is no minimum contribution (unless you and your members agree on a minimum) and provided your account has a balance of R500 or more, the club will remain active. Once your club has saved enough, all you need is two signatories and you'll have the funds available within five days to spend on any Flight Centre holiday. And, although Flight Centre doesn't offer any interest, there are amazing discounts on offer based on your club's saving patterns and balance. And besides being guaranteed by Flight Centre – one of the world's biggest and most reputable travel companies – your money is also safeguarded by a leading financial institution.
