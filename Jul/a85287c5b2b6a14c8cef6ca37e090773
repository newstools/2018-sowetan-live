Ivory Park Taxi Association (Ipta) chairman Johannes Mkhonza has denied that his association was involved in the taxi violence over the Mall of Africa route. Mkhonza was reacting to media reports linking the recent spate of taxi killings which claimed 15 lives in two weeks to revenge attacks following a dispute over the mall's lucrative route. However, sources confirmed this to Sowetan as reported on Wednesday. "Ivory Park Taxi Association has maintained a good relationship with other local taxi associations and we have never had any dispute with any association over the Mall of Africa route..." Mkhonza said yesterday. On Saturday, 11 people linked to Ipta were massacred in KwaZulu-Natal. The group, travelling in a minibus, was returning from the burial of the association's member Nkosi Mthembu in Greyton. "It has been a very difficult situation for us... People from all corners of Gauteng have been calling me since Sunday morning. These drivers did not get permission from the office to go there," Mkhonza said on Monday.
