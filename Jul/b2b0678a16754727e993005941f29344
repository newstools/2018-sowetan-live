Police and security personnel are responding to a cash-in-transit heist on the R33 near Dungamanzi in central KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday afternoon. A source with knowledge of the incident‚ who spoke to SowetanLIVE on condition of anonymity‚ said the cash van was stopped by a gang of armed men near Dundee. An explosive charge was laid and there was an explosion. The gang is understood to have made off with money. He added that an ambulance had been requested at the scene. This is the first recorded use of explosives in cash-in-transit heists in KwaZulu-Natal in recent history. Police spokesman Vish Naidoo had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publishing. The latest heist follows what police hailed as a significant breakthrough in the war on cash-in-transit bombings‚ with the arrest of 23 people - including a Tshwane Metro policewoman - in raids across Pretoria and Johannesburg last week. These arrests bring the total number of suspected cash heist robbers caught since May to 50. This is a developing story.
