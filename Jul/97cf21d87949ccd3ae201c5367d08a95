Are you tired of political parties lying to you? Well, there is a new party in town and it promises a divine intervention to state matters. Businesswoman Thandi Mnyandu-Mudau says she founded Light of Christian Party as "an instruction from God Himself". Mnyandu-Mudau said she first heard God's voice commanding her to launch the party in 2015 but she hesitated as she felt unhappy due to the challenges that come with running political organisations. "In January 2015, I totally refused until He came back in November 2015," she said. "The delay was caused by the fact that I'm not a politician. It was like being thrown in the deep end." Eventually, she said, she was overcome by the fear of God and decided to finally launch her party. "At the end of the day [I started asking myself] what will I say when I reach heaven [without having launched the party] and God says to me 'I'd given you a mandate but you never did anything about it'. "Whatever I will be doing [by entering into politics] it will not be through my own knowledge," she chuckled. Mnyandu-Mudau said God earlier taught her how she should hear His voice. "In the past 18 years, I would hear the voice and when He said open a Christian party I knew that this is God because He trains you to hear His voice." The businesswoman originally from KwaMashu, Durban, has interests in retail and construction. "I'm excited about it because it's a territory that I don't know, but I'm trusting God with everything I'm doing, " she told Sowetan ahead of the official launch in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg, tomorrow. "God's going to do things in different ways. People are going to come. there'll be websites and people will start joining. "But we know that churches are interested. Even in the complex where I'm staying, people are interested."
