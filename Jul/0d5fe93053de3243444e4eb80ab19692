Municipal elections in Mozambique scheduled for October 10 could be delayed, an official said Wednesday, after disagreement between the ruling Frelimo party and opposition Renamo on peace negotiations. The government and Renamo, which has an armed militant wing, have been in peace talks after unrest erupted between 2013 and 2016. The disarmament and integration of Renamo fighters into the regular army and police has been a major sticking point in talks, with the government demanding the immediate disbanding of Renamo forces. Parliament should have approved the electoral law last month to allow the election on October 10. "We have no procedural law to organise elections. Let's wait until Parliament approves the law then we will re-establish the elections," Paulo Cuinica said in press conference in the capital Maputo. Renamo accepts disarming its military wing, but says demilitarisation should take place after the elections. Renamo fought a bloody 16-year civil war against the ruling Frelimo party until 1992. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama played a key role in advancing the peace process with President Filipe Nyusi, but his death in May from a suspected heart attack aged 65 threw the talks into doubt.
