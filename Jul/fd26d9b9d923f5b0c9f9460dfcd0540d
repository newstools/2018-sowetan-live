The GaRankuwa Magistrate's Court, north of Pretoria,  will today hand down sentence to the ANC councillor convicted of four counts of rape and robbery. Emmanuel Sipho Maselane, 33, an ANC councillor in ward 9 in Tshwane, has been convicted of the rape of four females, including two 14-year-old girls, and robbery. ANC and DA members in party regalia have arrived in court ahead of the sentencing.  The DA Women’s Network (Dawn) has called for a harsh sentence, especially because two of Maselane's victims were minors. Maselane committed the crimes three years ago. He lured his victims by giving them lifts and driving them to secluded areas where he raped them and stole their belongings.
