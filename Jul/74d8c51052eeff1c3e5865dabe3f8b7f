The Kusile project will include a power station precinct, power station buildings, administrative buildings, roads and a high-voltage yard. The Eskom loan forms part of the 14 agreements which were signed between South Africa and China at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Tuesday. The agreements include the visa deal, financial agreement and a special agreement for the development of SMME’s on the continent.

We have agreed that we must work together.” Ramaphosa said Jinping sees Africa as a special continent.
