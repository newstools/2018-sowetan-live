The weekend may have been owned by France's FIFA World Cup win over the weekend but that was not the only reason a number of celebrities were celebrating. While many, like Naomi Campbell, attended the world cup game and closing ceremony performer Will Smith, the weekend was filled with celebs having a great time with their baes, birthday parties and baby showers. We look at six local and international celebrities who made the most of their weekend. Naomi Campbell was feeling the FIFA World Cup spirit where she rooted for eventual winners France. She watched the game live in a fabulous white Azzedine Ala√Øa dress. The rapper was all loved up with her boyfriend this weekend when they celebrated their four year anniversary. Moozlie also shared a loving message to her boo while gushing over her bouquet. Big on family time, big on fun, Dwayne Johnson spent part of his weekend having a swimming session with one of his daughters, Jasmine Johnson. Dwayne shared that adorable Jasmine likened his rock hard abs to "brown boobies." Carol Bouwer, celebrated her birthday this weekend with a glamorous entourage of her female friends. Bouwer took the lead as the ladies entered Grande Provence Heritage Wine Estate in this killer video. We are definitely entering this week like Bouwer and her besties. She may have kept the new of her bun in the oven under wraps for months but Jessica Nkosi more than made up for it with her fabulous baby shower. The actress was over the moon when she arrived at the surprise shower which included favourites like Ayanda Thabethe and Duma Ntando. Lehasa Moloi was pushing hard to keep his body summer ready. Rather than pick up the winter fat, he motivated his followers to push through and stick to their winter workout regime, like a boss.
