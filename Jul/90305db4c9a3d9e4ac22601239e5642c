Ajax Cape Town's last throw of the dice to get back to the Premiership will be decided at the South Gauteng High Court this afternoon. Judgment is expected to be handed down for leave to appeal a decision that resulted in the relegation of the club to the National First Division. Arbitrator Advocate William Mokhari (SC) found Ajax guilty of fielding an ineligible player in Tendai Ndoro, and subsequently docked the club points for their violation. The Mother City club and Ndoro broke the Fifa rule that a footballer may not play for three clubs in a single season. The effect that the arbitration ruling had on the league standing was such that Ajax were automatically relegated, while Platinum Stars moved up to 15th and qualified for the play-offs that were won by Black Leopards. Judge Denise Fischer will give her verdict which, if it's in favour of Ajax, could mean the replay of the play-offs - and possibly the rearrangement of the Premiership log standings. After the confirmation that the club had parted ways with Ndoro last week, coach Muhsin Ertugral said the decision was best for both parties. Ertugral said they would live with whatever decision comes out of the Johannesburg court. "I think everyone at this point is ready to move on and put this behind us once and for all," Ertugral said. "Whatever happens I have taken a vow to continue with the club and to coach those wonderful group of boys "This whole thing has been very unfortunate and has affected a lot of people. I certainly feel that the rule should be changed to maybe limit a player to three different leagues or federations and not simply three clubs."
