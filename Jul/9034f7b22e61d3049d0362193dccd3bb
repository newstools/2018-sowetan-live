A biography of French soccer megastar Kylian Mbappé, likely to be the first of many, has been slated for a September release. Icon Books is behind "Mbappé," a new biography from Luca Caioli, an Italian sports journalist who is the author of previous titles including "Messi" and "Ronaldo," and French journalist and author Cyril Collot. The book will tell the story of Mbappé's brief but shining career so far. After making his professional debut for Monaco in 2015 at just 16 years old, in the summer of 2017 he became one of the world's most expensive players when he was traded to Paris Saint-Germain. Tipped as a potential rival to the legacies of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Mbappé became the second-ever teenager after Brazilian Pelé to score in a World Cup final when France won the World Cup earlier this month. That goal was the most-tweeted moment of the World Cup tournament. "Mbappé" will be out on September 27, 2018.
