Free State Stars coach Luc Eymael wishes Giovanni Solinas the best of luck as Kaizer Chiefs coach, with the Belgian insisting that he is not at all bitter after missing out on the Chiefs' head coach job. The Italian won the race to be Chiefs coach after the club went four months without a head coach since Steve Komphela's resignation in April. There was a point in the last few months where Eymael was regarded as the favourite to get the Amakhosi job. On Friday, Chiefs put an end to all the speculation when they made the former Stars boss their coach. "He speaks French and he was at Stars when I was at Polokwane City and he was also in Algeria at ES Setif," said Eymael after Ea Lla Koto lost 6-5 on penalties in the Bokone Bophirima Maize Cup to a Chiefs side guided by Patrick Mabedi. Solinas, who's yet to finalise his work permit, could only watch from the stands as Amakhosi clinched the Maize Cup at James Motlatsi Stadium on Saturday. "He's a good coach who likes his team to play with plenty of possession so all the best to him at Kaizer Chiefs," Eymael said. Eymael, who won the Nedbank Cup with Stars last season, insists there were no hard feelings after a potential move to SuperSport United also failed to materialise. "If no big team wants to sign me it's no problem. I have said before that I will show commitment to Stars if no concrete offer comes in," he said.
