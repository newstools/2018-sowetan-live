Seven-time champion Serena Williams reached the Wimbledon final for the 10th time on Thursday and will face Germany’s Angelique Kerber for the title. The 25th seeded American downed German 13th seed Julia Goerges 6-2, 6-4 to book her place in her 30th Grand Slam final. The 36-year-old, who will be in her first final at the majors since giving birth to daughter Olympia last year, can equal Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 Slam titles if she beats Kerber in what will be a repeat of the 2016 final at the All England Club.
