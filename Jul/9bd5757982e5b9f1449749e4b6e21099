Uncertainty reigns at SuperSport United as Kaitano Tembo, 47, remains in charge of the senior team, yet the club has not given him the head coaching job on a permanent basis. With a little over two weeks to go before the start of the new season, Tembo is likely to be in charge, come August 3. Although he said they have big plans for Tembo, club chief executive Stan Matthews was non-committal about a permanent job for the Zimbabwean. "He is in charge at the moment and that is the way it is staying for the time being. We have a few options locally and abroad," Matthews told Sowetan. "We have been open with Kaitano and he has got the inside lane. And that is the way it will stay unless we bring someone from the outside. "It would have to be someone very special for us to bring someone in from the outside." It is understood that a number of options include either bringing in a technical adviser or a new coach. Matthews said that should the club opt to commit to Tembo for the upcoming campaign, they would look to support him. "We are quite determined to bring some international element to the club, especially if Kaitano stays on as coach," he added. "He worked with the Dutch system from our partnership with Feyenoord. We are definitely going to have some sort of Dutch influence within the club over the next three years." Matthews says they want to give Tembo the platform they gave Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane to become an elite tactician. "He and Pitso have very different personalities because no two people are alike. But what I see is desire, hunger and loyalty. "A genuineness to help the young players and to hold the senior players responsible. He is one of our own and has come through the ranks. Everyone at the club is motivated to help him to succeed," said Matthews.
