A 30-year-old man  appeared in the Mothibistad Magistrate's Court in Kuruman, Northern Cape, on Friday on allegations of murder. Jacob Mokgwabone  was granted  R2 000  bail and is expected to appear in the same court on August 30. Mokgwabone handed himself over to the police on Wednesday after he allegedly shot and killed a  17-year-old Grade 10 pupil at Makgolokwe Middle School at Batlharos village outside Kuruman. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi said the suspect told the police that a group of boys from the school attacked him with stones and he retaliated by shooting.  “Unfortunately, the 17-year-old boy was hit and he died at the scene,” Mooi said. At the time, the Northern Cape department of education made promises to send officials to the school to provide counselling.
