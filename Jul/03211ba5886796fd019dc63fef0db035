Gauteng parents who applied for 2019 admissions for grades 1 and 8 pupils will know next month about the placement of their children. The Gauteng education department opened an online application system for grades 1 and 8 in April and by the end of the application period in May, the department had received more than 569 302 applications Education spokesman Steve Mabona said parents will be informed about their applications on August 3 as more time is required to finalise the waiting list with the schools and districts. “Parents will receive a message advising them on the outcome of their applications. They can also log-on to gdeadmissions.gov.za to check the status of their application. They can also visit the nearest district office or public schools for any admission-related matters. We urge parents to accept offers of placement within seven working days of receipt of the offer,” Mabona said. He warned that failure to respond to the offer within seven working days will result in the forfeiture of the offer to the next applicant on the school’s waiting list. “Placement will be conducted on a first-come first-served basis. It must be noted that space availability is the key determinant of learners to be placed in a school. Those parents who failed to submit the required documents to schools during the allocated timeframe can submit their documents at district offices from September 10  till September 14,” Mabona said.
