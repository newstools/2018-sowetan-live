Having discovered local stars such as Morgan Gould, Reneilwe Letsholonyane and retired Zambian-born goal machine Christopher Katongo among many others, SA legendary football figure Jomo Sono has been asked to do the same in Kenya. Former Kenyan prime minister Raila Odinga has requested Sono to help establish a football academy in Kenya. Odinga wants Jomo Cosmos' owner-coach to lend a hand in uplifting the standard of football in the east African nation. While he still contemplates Odinga's idea, Sono has registered his interest to assist, but the former Bafana Bafana tactician hints there might be financial obstacles that could jeopardise the establishment of the academy. "I was there on business [two weeks ago] and Odinga engaged me about his desire of developing football in Kenya," said Sono. "He proposed that I establish an academy there to nurture raw talent. "They know that I have produced many players in SA; now they want me to do the same in their country. "Yes, I am interested to do it, because it's for the interest of football at large, but at this stage it's hard to accept the proposal because these things need money. I will be glad to help Kenya in that regard [of football development]." Sono has challenged himself to conduct a research on Kenyan football, admitting the only thing he knows about that country's football is Tottenham Hotspur midfield enforcer Victor Wanyama. "I need to do a lot of research about their state of football before I consider this whole thing. The only thing I know about Kenyan football is that they've got Wanyama. But I have since challenged myself to dig deeper to be knowledgeable about their football."
