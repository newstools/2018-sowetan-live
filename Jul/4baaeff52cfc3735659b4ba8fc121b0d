We all know that Zimbabwe is still recovering from hellish economic conditions brought about by former president Robert Mugabe who was picking fights with everyone who disagreed with him. I read a sad story out of Venezuela where citizens have started eating donkey meat because of food shortages due to a tough economic climate. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro recently said he was going to remove five zeroes from his country's hyper inflation-hit currency. That also won't work. Looking closely at what led to problems in both Zimbabwe and Venezuela, you will note that it was a misguided revolutionary agenda. If you look at what sustains most countries, their ability to separate economy from politics is top on the list. Most countries trade with countries they don't necessarily like politically. Sadly, the late Hugo Chavez, current incumbent Maduro, and Mugabe, didn't see the difference. It's, therefore, worrying that we have politicians in South Africa who want to plunge the country into the same economic quagmire. We have so-called revolutionaries who are hellbent on destroying this country with war talk. There's no doubt that the issue of land needs to be sorted out, but it must not be used to destabilise the country. Certain political leaders display worrying dictatorial traits, where leaders can't be wrong. Whenever you disagree with them, even on social networks, you get a barrage of insults. This is not the future we need for our country. Once we promote cult politics then we're on the wrong path because that would be grooming dictators. People with misguided revolutionary tendencies can destroy the country. Richardson Mzaidume Pimville
