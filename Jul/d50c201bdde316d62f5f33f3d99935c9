Taxpayers will fund former president Jacob Zuma's fight to avoid personally paying an estimated R10-million in legal fees spent on his disastrous State Capture court cases. But, the state attorney's office has claimed that Zuma will be required to pay back the money spent on that appeal if he loses the case. "The State Attorney will prepare and facilitate the signing of a detailed agreement in which the former president undertakes to refund the state all fees and disbursements incurred in the event that he is not successful in the appeal proceedings," State Attorney Isaac Chowe wrote in a letter to Zuma's lawyers. He said the state attorney would make sure that the fees would be paid "in accordance with the fair and reasonable tariffs discussed with the State Attorney's office..." As yet, it remains unclear whether Zuma has actually signed the so-called "refund deal". The letter comes as the legality of Zuma's past and present legal funding by the state is currently being challenged by the DA and the EFF. Last month, the Presidency said it had agreed to fund Zuma's fees in respect of his corruption and racketeering cases but stressed that Zuma would need to apply, through the state attorney.
