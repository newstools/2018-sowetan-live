Meshack Bevhula has come a long way from being unemployed and holding a placard on a street corner pleading for help to have his book published. The 28-year-old from Giyani in Limpopo has now realised his dream. His book, Drowning in Own Tears, was published in May, and to top it all he has found employment as a data processor at the SA National Road Agency Limited (Sanral). "There was a time when I wanted to give up because things were not coming through for me. But I maintained to look for a publisher." His book is a fictional novel about issues that cripple black communities, such as poverty. Bevhula, who has sold over 150 copies since May, said that Drowning in Own Tears is filled with romance, betrayal, secrets and motivation. He said he initially approached several mainstream publishers but his idea was rejected. In 2016, he decided to hit the streets with placards begging for help. He was approached by award-winning author and the chief editor of Classic Age Publishers, Vukulu Maphindani, who saw the widely shared picture of him standing on a Vosloorus street corner. Maphindani praised the author for his tenacity and desire to succeed against all odds. He said, however, that Bevhula's book had earlier been rejected for various reasons. "He kept submitting books until he sent us Drowning in Own Tears, which I found very inspiring," said Maphindani. Bevhula has never looked back since. "I feel like I was born to write. Even when I feel hopeless, the only thing that brings back my focus is writing," said Bevhula. He studied business administration at PC Business and Training College but is currently studying a film-making course at the African Academy of Cinematic Arts because of his passion for telling stories. "I have a strong passion for storytelling. It is for that reason that I also want to tell untold stories, not only in my books but also in movies," he said.
