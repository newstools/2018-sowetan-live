Dozens of angry Vodacom customers are marching to the cellphone network giant in Midrand to demand that the company pay "Please Call Me" inventor Nkosana Makate. Armed with placards that read "Vodacom pay Makate", "Vodacom stop racism" and chanting Struggle songs, protesters are supported by motorists who hoot and raise their fists in the air. Customers say Vodacom had dragged the process to pay Makate for too long. Vodacom and Makate are in settlement negotiations following two years of failing to reach an agreement. In April 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled that Makate be recognised by Vodacom for his "Please Call Me" idea. The parties have been in negotiations since the ruling.
