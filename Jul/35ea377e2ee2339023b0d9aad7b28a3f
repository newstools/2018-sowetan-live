Cycling is young Nthathile Mofokeng's first love. The eight-year-old boy from Naledi, Soweto has recently completed a 35km fun race held on Youth Day in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria. "Riding my bicycle makes me feel so good. I love it," Mofokeng said. While his peers sleep the winter holiday mornings away, Mofokeng cycles around Soweto in preparation to conquer the next 20km race next month. He is a member of the Re Gata Mmogo Sports Club. The club was founded in 2010 by Benny Mabe to encourage Soweto residents, more so children, to be active and stay away from mischief. It has 13 children under the age of 10 years who have recently become members, but Mofokeng has proven to be the most passionate. "Nthathile is always encouraging us to train. Today we had dedicated the morning to fix the bicycles but he wanted us to hit the streets," Mabe said. Mofokeng officially joined the team three months ago after being inspired by his brother to train for long hours on weekends to keep up with the seasoned cyclists. His paddling skills and stamina have left Mabe in awe. "Now that it's the school holidays, I cycle everyday all over Soweto with my brother and the team," Mofokeng told Sowetan. The young cyclist, who is in Grade 2 at the Harmony Primary School in Lenasia, counted maths as one of his favourite school subjects. "When I cycle I can spend time with my brother and learn from him. I think that my friends wish that they could be me," Mofokeng said cheerfully. His 26-year-old brother Thabo said their family was proud of Mofokeng's achievements, and hopes to see his younger brother in cycling competitions such as the Tour de France in the future. "It feels good to know that I inspired my little brother to find his dream."
