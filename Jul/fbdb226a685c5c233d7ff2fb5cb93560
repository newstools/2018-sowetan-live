New SuperSport United striker James Keene insists that he did not join the club to be a replacement for Jeremy Brockie. After nearly three seasons at Bidvest Wits, Keene recently made the switch to Matsatsantsa a Pitori. Since his arrival in SA, the Englishman has scored 17 goals in 47 appearances. Keene said he was his own man and was a different goal-poacher to Brockie, who joined Mamelodi Sundowns in January after scoring 54 goals. "Jeremy and I are different players, and I am not coming to fill in anyone's shoes because there is no comparison," Keene told Sowetan. "I was brought in for what I do. Jeremy was fantastic for the club after scoring more than 50 goals, which is incredible. But you don't buy a player to replace another although we are both proven goal scorers." The 32-year-old admitted that he had enjoyed his time in South Africa playing in the Premiership. "I signed in the later parts of last season and I wanted to secure my future. It was time for new challenges and new goals," he said. "It's been very good so far after having two and a half seasons at Wits. I won the league and the Telkom Knockout, I have really enjoyed my time in SA. My wife and I will be here for the foreseeable future." At the Tshwane club, the former Portsmouth attacker will fight for a place in the starting team with fellow strikers Thabo Mnyamane, Bradley Grobler and Evan Rusike. Keene has been impressed with the strike force at Matsatsantsa. "Whenever I've played I have scored, so it is up to what the coach wants to do with me. I believe I still offer a lot to the team," he said. "We have a combination of young and experienced players. There many exciting prospects in the team so we have a lot of good players and competition is healthy."
