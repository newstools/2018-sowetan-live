The 2016/17 Absa Premiership champions Bidvest Wits were by far the shadows of themselves last season and many pinpointed their transfer dealings as one of the factors for their below par campaign. But this time around the students look more prudent as to who they sign for the impending campaign after bolstering their squad with goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo, striker Mxolisi Macuphu and midfielder Bantu Mzwakali. The trio were at Chippa United last season. The Clever Boys are also expected to conclude a deal with Bloemfontein Celtic speedy winger Deon Hotto. The Namibian international is said to have already agreed to personal terms with the Gavin Hunt-coached outfit. Last season Wits reinforced their league winning squad with the likes of ex-Bafana Bafana skipper Steven Pienaar, winger Daylon Claasen, young attacker Kobamelo Kodisang and Montenegrin defender Slavo Damjanovic. Nevertheless, only Claasen and Kodisang showed flashes of brilliance amid the club’s torrid campaign. Pienaar and Damjanovic were released barely six months after joining the university club. The pair failed to live up to expectations, leaving many questioning the club’s transfer dealings. Wits’ new signings indicate that the club have learnt from their past flops where they signed the likes of Pienaar while they had many players in the similar position. For example players like Ben Motshwari who have since joined Orlando Pirates after finding playing opportunities hard to come by at the Braamfontein-based side. Having already parted ways with experienced goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs, who joined AmaZulu, Wits made good decision to capture Mhlongo. Likewise, signing Macuphu and Mzwakali plugs the slots left by Motshwari and Eleazar Rodgers, who was snatched by Free State Stars.
