SuperSport United boss Stan Matthews has given goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse the green light to find a new club after the goalkeeper complained about lack of game time. Pieterse joined Matsatsantsa a Pitori in 2016 from Kaizer Chiefs with the hope of getting more game time. The 26-year-old has, however, spent more time on the bench than he would have liked due to Ronwen Williams being the number one choice. Sowetan has established that Cape Town City is one of the clubs interested in Pieterse, who made 17 appearances last season. "Reyaad has expressed that he hasn't gotten the game time he would have liked last season," Matthews told Sowetan. "I don't think he is that happy. The discussion I had with him was that if there is a move out there for him then we would entertain it. "He has delivered for me and is a true professional but Ronwen, who has been with us since he was 12, has proven to be our number one choice. "There has been some interest in Reyaad, both locally and internationally. We are open to it but that is something that him, his agent and myself are talking about. We have given him the green light if a good offer comes." The club has been relatively quiet in the transfer market, having only signed James Keene from Bidvest Wits, Luke Fleur from Ubuntu Cape Town and goalkeeper Washington Arubi from AmaTuks. Matthews said they were looking to add two more players and insisted that their inactivity was due to the R7-million loss the club suffered after reaching the CAF Confederation Cup final in November. "Last year we took a knock, but that is a thing of the past. We are not looking to do much in the transfer window. Probably we will make two moresignings - one defensive and in attack."
