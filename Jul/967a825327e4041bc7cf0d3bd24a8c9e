Augustine Mulenga's rocket for Orlando Pirates against Bloemfontein Celtic at Orlando Stadium in April is still fresh in the fans' memory. It was so good that it has been voted the club's best goal for the 2017/18 season. It was a game to remember for the Zambian marksman as his moment of brilliance even overshadowed defender Happy Jele's 200th appearance on the night. Coming off the bench, Mulenga cut inside and passed the ball over to Thembinkosi Lorch who returned the favour and the former unleashed an unstoppable shot that could have beaten any goalkeeper in the world. At the time, Pirates were still in with a chance to win the league, but in the end lost out to eventual winners Mamelodi Sundowns. Bucs fans are hoping for more now that Mulenga is settled and looking forward to his first full season after joining from Zanaco in January. The 28-year-old wants nothing more than pleasing the Pirates faithful as they seek their first trophy after a four-season barren run. "This coming season I know that the fans are going to expect a lot from me," the Zambian acknowledged. "What I can say is that I'm not putting pressure on myself, but I'll work hard and do what I can do. "I've got qualities and I can deliver," he said. Mulenga continued: "I'm not under pressure. My target this season is to score more than 10 goals; that's what I can say and I can't promise much. I can't promise that I will score 15 or 20 goals, but I can say more than 10." Pirates will also be involved in the CAF Champions League from November and Mulenga, who's played in the tournament with his former side Zanaco, will bring in his experience to Bucs.
