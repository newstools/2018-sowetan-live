Football agent Tim Sukazi's Quality Talent Sports (QTS) has agreed to pay a fine of more than R114 000 for fixing commission fees when negotiating deals for players and coaches. The sports agency reached a settlement with the Competition Commission to pay the fine after pleading guilty of "fixing the price of commission fees and fixing trading conditions". QTS, which represents players and coaches, along with 36 other football intermediaries, was investigated for collusion. Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele said: "It's encouraging that someone owns up and undertakes to assist the investigation and prosecution, not waste our time and valuable resources. In turn, QTS has been able to negotiate a palatable settlement that takes into account the fact that they have shown remorse and regret their unlawful actions." QTS agreed to pay R114 168.84 after pleading guilty. The agency is a member of the SA Football Intermediaries Association (Safia). An investigation found that Safia and its members were engaging in cartel behaviour. "Safia and its members agreed to charge soccer players and coaches a standard 10% commission fee when negotiating transfer fees and contracts on their behalf. "They charge football players a standard 20% commission fee when negotiating commercial contracts; and they use Safia as a platform for collusion." The probe stemmed from 2015 when there was a debacle about agent commissions and fees. Fifa and SA Football Association wanted to regulate the rate of commission that agents receive down to 3%. Safia complained to the Competition Commission that setting a cap would be a violation of the Competition Act. When the findings of the investigations were released they showed that Safia were the ones actually in the wrong.
