The charge relates to his involvement in an alleged Gupta family plot to bribe former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas. Duduzane Zuma faces an alternative charge of conspiracy to commit corruption. Lawyer Rudi Krause spoke to the publication just after Zuma had been processed at the Johannesburg Central police station‚ and confirmed that the 34-year-old had agreed to hand in his passport as part of a bail agreement with the state. “They are charging with him for corruption in the main and conspiracy as an alternative,” Krause said “The state is not opposing bail.” Duduzane Zuma arrived at the police station just after 7am this morning‚ and greeted journalists as he walked inside. “Hello‚” he said‚ “are you well?” Zuma’s charges are apparently in connection with the role he allegedly played in an incident where Jonas has said there was an attempt to bribe him at the Guptas' Saxonwold home in 2015. He will be appearing at the Randburg Magistrates Court later this week‚ to face two charges of culpable homicide. - Additional reporting by Tankiso Makhetha
