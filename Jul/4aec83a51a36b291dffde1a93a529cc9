If you spent your weekend indoors bingeing on your favourite series, staying warm with a book in bed or rooting for your favourites between the Kaizer Chiefs and Sundown's match, you might find yourself absolutely envious of what celebs got up to this weekend. Staying in bed was definitely not on the cards for some of our favourites. From Faith Evans jetting off to London after her much talked about Las Vegas wedding, to Bonang and Lorna Maseko's epic Ibiza getaway, here is what some of your favourite celebs got up to this weekend. Faith Evans may have left many clutching their invisible pearls last week after her surprise wedding to Love and Hip Hop Atlanta star, Stevie J but the newlywed Mrs Jordan was not going to let the honeymoon butterflies slow her down while performing in London. TV queens, Bonang Matheba and Lorna Maseko have been serving a hot plate of body goals this weekend. The inseparable pair was seen living la vida loca at Ushuaia Ibiza Beach Hotel. Thembisa Mdoda was front and centre at the African premier of film Baby Mammas in Durban. Fellow cast mate Salamina Mphelo shared a snap of her and Dineo Ranaka who also stars in the movie. As a talk show host and author, Redi Tlhabi has been fearless with the stories she tells. However, when the radio presenter attended a kid's birthday party she wasn't so fearless when she was confronted by a Burmese python. DJ Zinhle was a dream in fur; here she is serving fashion goals with one of her buddies before painting the town red. Kevin Hart proved that dynamites come in funny little packages. When he is not on set for his latest movie, the comedian wows crowds with his lauded stand-up acts. Here he is killing the crowd in Canada.
