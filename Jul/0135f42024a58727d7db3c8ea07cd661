Agent Mmatsatsi Sefalafala has expressed gratitude to Brighton & Hove Albion for not giving up on the transfer of her client, Percy Tau, even after it appeared that the deal had fallen through last month. Tau finally completed his R50-million move to the English Premier League side last week after a lengthy impasse with Mamelodi Sundowns. In a message directed to the club chairman Tony Bloom and coach Chris Hughton, Sefalafala said: "From day one since we started having discussions in March 2018, your team has been very professional and remained professional throughout the process. "You gave me the greatest honour and respect and believed in my ability to do this. Most importantly, thank you for never losing hope and for persevering even when it seemed impossible to make the deal happen." Tau concluded the deal which was confirmed on Albion's social media pages on Friday after the Bafana star refused to join Sundowns for their pre-season camp. Sefalafala and Tau started their working relationship back in 2010 when the striker was just 16. Since that time, she has been involved in all the movements that the 24-year-old has made, from joining the Brazilians to going on loan to Witbank Spurs in 2016 and now playing in England. In the end, a PSL record-breaking transfer fee was agreed between the two clubs. On the lucrative transfer that made Tau an instant millionaire, Sefalafala added: "It gives me a great pleasure to share with you, my fellow South African citizens and the rest of the world, my joy and excitement to have been a part of making history by facilitating Percy Tau's record-breaking transfer from Mamelodi Sundowns to Brighton & Hove Albion."
