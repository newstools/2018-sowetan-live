After Chippa United decided against renewing his contract last month, well-travelled striker Katlego "Mahoota" Mashego is mulling his football future after a PSL career spanning nearly 20 years. Asked whether retirement has crossed his mind, Mashego, 36, said he would only decide his next move by the end of the month. The Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga-born, striker is also studying towards a Bachelor of Law (LLB) degree through Unisa. "Yes, I have left Chippa. My contract expired but I have not decided what to do next. By the end of this month I will make an announcement about my future plans. "At the moment I am training alone and I am busy with other personal stuff," Mashego told Sowetan yesterday. Mashego indicated last year that his priority was to "finish my studies because I do not know what will happen after I have stopped playing". The striker has been the journeyman of South African football, having turned out for eight local top-flight clubs such as Hellenic, SuperSport United, Mamelodi Sundowns, Golden Arrows and Orlando Pirates. Since making his top-flight debut with the now-defunct Hellenic in 2001, Mashego has always scored goals for every club he has played for. The veteran striker has made more than 240 Premiership appearances - scoring 73 goals in the process. Winning his maiden Premiership title with Matsatsantsa a Petori in 2008 remains Mashego's biggest career highlight, despite adding three more at Pirates and Sundowns. "My first title as a professional footballer at SuperSport remains my proudest moment in my career. "I have played for many teams and it has been a long journey," noted the 2012/2013 season's top scorer with 13 goals while he was still at Moroka Swallows.
