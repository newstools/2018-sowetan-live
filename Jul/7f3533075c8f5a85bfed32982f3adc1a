A Grade 10 learner from Makgolokwe  Middle School in Northern Cape was shot dead on school premises on Wednesday. The Northern Cape department of education said it was  shocked by the incident. Department's spokesman Geoffrey van der Merwe said it was still unclear what exactly transpired or triggered the incident. "The incident occurred during school hours and the perpetrator, who is not a fellow learner, has handed himself over to the police. We have deployed our employee support services to the school to provide counselling to educators and learners who were directly and indirectly affected by the incident," Van der Merwe said.
