The ANC caucus in Tshwane metro has called on mayor Solly Msimanga and corporate services MMC Cilliers Brink to resign "or be pushed out" after a second controversial appointment in the mayor's office surfaced this week. The ANC had raised issue with Stefan de Villiers' appointment in the mayor's office, alleging Msimanga had hired a "bodybuilder without any qualification except a questionable bodybuilders certificate in a position that requires 12 years of experience and post-matric qualification". De Villiers is appointed as executive head for private office of the executive mayor of Tshwane, and it is understood that he earns an annual salary of about R1-million, that he had matric and was enrolled at University of South Africa. The furore around De Villiers' appointment comes about two months after Msimanga's chief of staff Marietha Aucamp had to resign after it emerged that she did not have the relevant qualifications for the position. The ANC alleged that Brink and Msimanga had participated in head-hunting Aucamp, and that they also employed De Villiers. Msimanga yesterday said that De Villiers was a "political appointment". He said all government leaders appointed and needed support staff who could be trusted to land their party's policies in government, communicate its message and handle sensitive information. "Stefan is by far the most qualified candidate for this ..." Msimanga said the city would consider a different recruitment process for political support staff, including media spokespersons, policy advisers, strategy advisers and events and diary coordinators.
