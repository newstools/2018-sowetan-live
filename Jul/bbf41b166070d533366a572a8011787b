Five things you need to know about former president Jacob Zuma's third court appearance in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday. Zuma is charged with 16 charges that include fraud‚ corruption and racketeering. These charges relate to 783 payments which he allegedly received as a bribe to protect French arms company‚ Thales‚ from an investigation into the controversial multi-billion rand arms deal. The alleged bribe was facilitated by Zuma’s former financial adviser‚ Schabir Shaik. 1. The holding date for his criminal trial is November 30. 2. Zuma has abandoned his application for the National Prosecuting Authority to review the charges against him. His legal representative‚ Advocate Michael Hellens‚ told the Pietermaritzburg High Court that the former president would instead apply for a permanent stay of prosecution. 3. Zuma won't be changing his legal team again. His former attorney‚ Michael Hulley‚ was official excused on Friday following issues over funding‚ however Zuma's new team led by Advocate Michael Hellens "is here to stay". Hellens confidently told the court that there will be no funding issues with the new team. The state is currently funding Zuma's legal battle pending a North Gauteng High Court application brought by the DA for the former president to pay his own way. 4. The director of National Prosecuting Authority Shaun Abrahams plans to bring another charge against Zuma's co-accused Thales but the charge mentioned does not exist under SA law.
