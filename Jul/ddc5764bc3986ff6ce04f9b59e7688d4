On-loan Baroka attacker Emmanuel Letlotlo feels the reason he has not shone since making his professional debut is due to being played out of position. Letlotlo joined Baroka earlier this month on a one-year loan deal from Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs. Like many youth development players at Naturena who get promoted to the first team, the 22-year-old struggled to make an impact and has now been shipped out to Limpopo. Though grateful to have been handed his debut by former Chiefs coach Steve Komphela, he hinted that he was not used correctly. "The little chance I got when I played under Steve, I played as a winger and did not play to my strength, so I was not that effective," Letlotlo told Sowetan. "As a winger I would be forced to cut inside and did not get many scoring opportunities. My best position is as a striker because my biggest strength is my powerful shot and quickness." Since making his debut in August 2016 against Bidvest Wits, Letlotlo has not risen to the heights he was earmarked for. Last season he made only six appearances for Chiefs. The athlete grew up in Soweto but calls Ga-Mamadi, Limpopo home, as his mother lives there. He feels Bakgaga are a good fit for him. He will work under coach Wedson Nyirenda, who played for Chiefs. "I've come here to work and score goals and that I am confident of because they said they will give me a chance. I think their style of play suits my game. Many of the players are young like me, so we understand each other. "When [Chiefs team manager] Bobby [Motaung] told me I would come to Baroka on loan, I did not have a problem with that. I knew I was coming closer to home and would get more game time."
