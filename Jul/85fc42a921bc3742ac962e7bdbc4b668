Kaizer Chiefs have one final test to go before the start of the new season where expectations will be high that their three-season drought comes to an end. Amakhosi have a number of factors against them, including the fact that their new coach, Giovanni Solinas, will start his job without having had much a pre-season to speak of. The Italian is still waiting for his work permit after his appointment two weeks ago. This means he will be thrown straight into the deep end as the first time he is likely to be on the bench will be on the opening weekend of the season against defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday next week. (August 4). Chiefs will take on Cape Town City in the inaugural Mpumalanga Cultural Experience Cup at the Mbombela Stadium tomorrow (3pm). Young striker Dumisani Zuma refuted that it would work against them that Solinas has had so little time with the team. "As players I think we have been together for a while, so it won't be difficult for us although the coach was appointed not so long ago," Zuma said. "There have only been a few changes in the team but the core group is still there." The former Bloemfontein Celtic front-man admitted that Chiefs have disappointed many people over the past few years. "For a big team like Chiefs to go for so long without winning a trophy for the supporters is not right," he said. "As players, we have a responsibility to hold up the name of the club with pride. "Our pre-season has been going well even though we are still learning the methods of the new coach. But we are positive that things will go well," said Zuma. The 23-year-old believes that the Glamour Boys will play an attractive, attacking style of football under Solinas. "So far the formation of the coach is very attacking and I think our fans will be pleased with that," he concluded.
