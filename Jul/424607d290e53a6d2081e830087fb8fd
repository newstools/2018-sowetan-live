Over the past seasons, Kaizer Chiefs have been brave enough to throw their youngsters in the deep end to give them a taste of top-flight football. Wiseman Meyiwa and Siyabonga Ngezana are the latest from the club's development structures to ascend into the senior side . This is why Amakhosi's decision to let one of their budding defenders, Tristan Moses, join Mamelodi Sundowns has surprised many. If the flashes of brilliance Moses showed in the Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) last season are anything to go by, the Soweto giants will eventually regret letting him go. On the other hand, the 20-year-old defender may as well have killed his career, considering the fact that the Brazilians believe in buying tried and tested players. One of their academy graduates, Thendo Mukumela, has struggled to even make the match day squad. Interestingly, he is also a centre-back like Moses. "For now I'll play in the [Sundowns] MDC side, but I am optimistic that by next season I would have developed into a first-team player. I am not scared of competition, what I need is to work harder," Moses told Sowetan yesterday. Despite helping Amakhosi clinch the Multichoice Diski Shield last season, Moses said "circumstances" compelled him to join Sundowns. He would not elaborate but lauded the role Chiefs MDC mentor Arthur Zwane played in his development. "I would have liked to stay at Chiefs but there were circumstances, and we [him and his father who is his manager] decided that it's good to leave. I'm thankful to coach Arthur, he's the one who brought me to Chiefs. He has taught me many things. I am this player because of him," noted Moses
