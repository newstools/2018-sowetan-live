National First Division (NFD) stars have struggled to shine once they join top-flight clubs, with 2017/2018 season's top- scorer Sedwyn George the latest player to have failed in the elite league. New Baroka striker Ranga Chivaviro, who has joined Bakgaga from Ubuntu Cape Town, wants to buck this trend of second-tier players struggling to find their feet in the Premiership. George joined Ajax Cape Town as a hot property from Royal Eagles after winning NFD's Golden Boot with 20 goals. Last season he struggled to even make match-day squad, starting only one of the nine matches he played for Ajax, without scoring. "I know that in the past, players who have done well in the NFD have failed once they come to the Premiership. But I am positive I will break that chain. I don't want to be a statistic," Chivaviro said. "If I do get a chance to play, I promise I will reward Baroka with goals. I am ready for the Premiership." The lad from GaKgapane, Limpopo, feels he can only set his targets once Baroka finish their pre-season camp next week. "We are still in pre-season camp and I am still trying to forge combinations with other players. As much as I want the Golden Boot, I cannot say what I am targeting in terms of the number of goals," Chivaviro said.
