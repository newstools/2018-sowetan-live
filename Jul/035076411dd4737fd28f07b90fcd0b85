Seven months after her shack burnt down after it was struck by lightning, a 49-year-old Mpumalanga mother still lives in a tent while she waits for the house she was promised by the Dr JS Moroka local municipality. Elizabeth Masekenya from Lefiso village lives with her 12-year-old daughter. "They (municipality) just do not care. They have simply forgotten about us. Everything I had perished in that fire and all I received from the municipality is this tent," Masekenya said. She said they were living on donations and hand-outs from community members and could hardly sleep at night because the tent was not secure from both natural elements and criminality. She said her daughter, Nkele, a Grade 6 pupil, often returned home from school in tears because other pupils teased her about her family situation. "She is a bright child but this has affected her so much that at some stage she did not want to go to school. "Whenever she raises her hand to answer a question her classmates will simply say: 'This thing that stays in a tent'. "I am pleading for help from anybody," Masekenya said. Malesela Mothibi, a concerned community member, said he had spoken  directly to mayor Thulare Madileng about Masekenya's plight but nothing had thus far come of his desperate plea for help for the family. "I spoke to him in December after the shack burnt down. He promised to intervene but till today she is waiting. The last time the municipality engaged the mother was when they brought the tent [to her]. They were supposed to treat this matter as urgent but they do not care." Mayor Thulare Madileng said he make sure Masekenya's house would be prioritised.
