Mamelodi Sundowns will use their big local rivals, Kaizer Chiefs, to sharpen their rusty attack as they look to claw their way back into contention in the CAF Champions League. There are no better opponents than Chiefs to get the best out of the Brazilians during this desperate time in the continental competition. The Absa Premiership champions are expected to return to the country today after they plunged to the bottom of Group C following their 1-0 loss to AS Togo-Port on Tuesday. They will take on the same Togolese opposition in the return leg at the Lucas Moripe Stadium next Friday (July 27). Before that clash, Sundowns will first face Amakhosi in the Helix Cup at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. It will provide coach Pitso Mosimane with the opportunity to test his combinations and see which formation works best, especially now with Percy Tau and Khama Billiat gone. Tau is still working on a potential move to English Premiership side Brighton & Hove, while Billiat has joined Chiefs. Sundowns will now look to players like Sibusiso Vilakazi and Themba Zwane, as well as Jeremy Brockie, to lead the new era. It was thought that Brockie would benefit most from the departures of Tau and Billiat, but the New Zealand forward was left on the bench in Togo. The technical team will need Zwane and Vilakazi to be more lethal after contributing six goals each last season. Sundowns could also give their new Venezuelan striker Jose Ali Meza a run against Chiefs while they hope to finalise his registration for the CAF match next week. Sundowns have their work cut out in Group C with three games left before the knockout stages.
