Patricia de Lille has resigned as mayor of Cape Town. The announcement was made at a joint media briefing with DA leader Mmusi Maimane. De Lille’s resignation is effective from October 31. She will‚ however‚ remain a member of the DA. Maimane said that it had been mutually agreed that she resign. It was also announced that disciplinary action against her will be withdrawn. De Lille’s resignation comes just days before she was expected to appear before a public disciplinary hearing into her alleged nepotism and mismanagement of the city — allegations she has strongly denied. “This has been a long and difficult journey. This matter has already gone on for too long‚ and has sapped the energies and attentions of both parties from our core work‚ for which we apologise‚” Maimane said. “We were both desirous of finding a mutually agreeable resolution‚ and we have now done so. I am confident that this outcome is in the best interests of the people of Cape Town‚” he added.
