The first weekend of August was spectacular, with great sunny weather and plenty abuzz on the celeb streets. Based on all the activity on social media, the NBA Africa Game seems to have been the the talk of the town, with some of our local celebs in attendance. Other faves spent the weekend a little differently; from double dates to bachelorettes, let's take a look at what they got up to this weekend. Bonang literally painted the town red for the Courvoisier send off party which took place at Sumo nightclub in Joburg.  She was also joined by fellow ambassadors of the brand, Anatii and David Tlale. AKA and his daughter Kairo were too cute for words in their front row seats at the NBA Africa Game. Cardi B kept up with the Kardashians this past weekend, enjoying a girl's night with Kim K and Kris Jenner. Fitness Bunny Sbahle Mpisane showed off her curves in Lesotho this weekend when she hosted a boot camp for the Little Feet Foundation. Miguel's bae, Nazanin Mandi partied it up in Vegas this weekend as part of her bachelorette party. Looking at the pictures, we can assure you that it was lit!
