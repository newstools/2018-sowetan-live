Renowned altruists - veteran boxing promoters Rodney Berman and Jeff Ellis - will continue reaching out for the needy when they jointly stage a boxing tournament next week to raise funds for children diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses. Berman of Golden Gloves and Ellis' African Ring will organise their tournament at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park next Friday. It will be in a box-and-dine formation where tables of 10 will be sold to corporate world to enjoy a three-course meal. The tournament aims to support the laudable Reach for a Dream Foundation which, for the past 28 years, has brought hope, joy and healing to many South African children between the ages of three and 18 years. Children have used their dreams to fight life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and leukaemia, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, renal failure and various other blood disorders. Berman and Ellis - who have quietly helped many former world and South African boxing champions who are down and out financially by organising similar tournaments for them - said the tournament will also be used to honour veteran boxing writer Ron Jackson for his tremendous work dating back to the 1940s. It has been announced that there will be an auction on the night. Among some sport memorabilia to be auctioned include boxing gloves signed by recently crowned WBA Super, WBC, IBF and WBO unified cruiserweight champion Oleksandr Usyk - the Ukrainian who boasts victories against Daniel Bruwer, Johnny Muller and Thabiso Mchunu. One lucky boxing fan stands a chance to secure a pair of gloves singed by WBC, WBA Super and IBF middleweight champion Gennady "GGG" Golovkin from Kazakhstan who once fought in Berman's tournament in Monaco in 2015. Rowan Campbell and Thembani Hobyane will square off for the SA super middleweight vacant title.
