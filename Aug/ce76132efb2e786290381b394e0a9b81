With two points dropped against Baroka, Kaizer Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas was still pleased with his team's reaction after they went a goal down. Amakhosi conceded after 36 minutes at Peter Mokaba Stadium through an own goal by defender Daniel Cardoso, but were back level just before the interval with midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala scoring from a free-kick. Solinas was disappointed to drop two valuable points but was happy with his team's fighting spirit. "The reaction we had after conceding the goal was very positive. Immediately, the guys pushed forward and tried to equalise," said the Italian. "So the reaction is good. Yes, maybe we need more focus to solve the situation and have more determination." The former Free State Stars mentor has insisted that Chiefs will become a better side when they have more training sessions. "For a football team to improve you need training sessions, because in a training session you fix the mistakes," he said yesterday. "But we don't have time for training at the moment. We played Saturday [against Free State Stars], we played [Baroka] on Tuesday and we are playing on Friday [against Maritzburg United]. "We are travelling from Polokwane to Durban, so there's no time to fix the mistakes. But I am sure, I am confident, that in future when we have the time the team will improve." Solinas lamented that they have, like any other PSL team, a tight schedule, claiming the schedule is for "robots" and not for human beings. But the reality is that Chiefs' next match is also away in KZN where they face Maritzburg at Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow [8pm]. Amakhosi will be hoping to have Dumisani Zuma back. He missed the match against Baroka on Tuesday night after going down with the flu.
