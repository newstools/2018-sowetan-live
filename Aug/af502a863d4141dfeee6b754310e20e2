Mariztburg United skipper Siyanda Xulu is wary of suffering the proverbial curse of the overachievers by having a horrific follow-up season. The Team of Choice last season punched above their weight by finishing fourth in the Premiership and runners-up in the Nedbank Cup. Xulu doesn't want Maritzburg to suffer the same fate as past teams who struggled in the following campaign after exceeding expectations in the previous one. "In football you can never be content, we saw what happened with Wits when they won the league and struggled the next year," Xulu said as he alluded to Wits' relegation battle after winning the league. "It is a lesson for us not to get ahead of ourselves. We have to elevate our performances even more." The 26-year-old feels that the team should not put any unnecessary pressure on itself in the 2018/19 season. "This season, the ambition is to finish in the top-eight like we did last season when we ended up finishing fourth. We don't have to dream about making a top-three, we don't have to put pressure on our young players." His central-defensive pairing with Bevan Fransman last season conceded only 23 goals - the second best record. With Fransman having left to join Highlands Park, Xulu insists the team will still have a strong back-line. "Bevan was a magnificent professional, but other players have to step in now. "We've signed new players who are capable of doing what Bevan did." Having been appointed the new captain, Xulu is ready to lead the KZN club. "It's within me to lead the team and to always be there for my teammates." Maritzburg will face Golden Arrows in their league opener at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Sunday (3pm).
