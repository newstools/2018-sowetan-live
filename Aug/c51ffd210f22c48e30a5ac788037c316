Senior Zimbabwean opposition figure Tendai Biti was arrested as he tried to flee to neighbouring Zambia to seek asylum, his lawyer said Wednesday. Biti allegedly faces charges for inciting violence over the disputed result of last week's elections. "He was arrested at the Zambian border," Biti's lawyer Nqobizitha Mlilo told AFP, adding by text message that he was trying to seek asylum. The Criminal Investigations Department said in a statement on Tuesday that police were looking for the former finance minister and opposition figure Biti, MDC chairman Morgen Komichi and MDC youth leader Happymore Chidziva linked to last weekâ€™s violence. Zimbabweans had hoped the vote would rid the country of its global pariah status and launch an economic recovery, but have watched an all too familiar pattern where the ruling party is declared the winner and the opposition rejects the outcome. -Additional reporting by Reuters
