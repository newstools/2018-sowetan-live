The man accused of beating a car guard to death has been granted bail in the Johannesburg magistrate’s court. Philani Milton Mkhulisa, 25, made his second appearance in court Wednesday and was granted bail of R2 000. The state did not oppose his bail application. Wearing a black jacket and blue jeans, Mkhulisa sat quietly in the dock while magistrate Piet du Plessis announced his decision. His bail conditions include not coming within 500 metres of corner Pritchard and Rissik streets in the Johannesburg CBD. He must also remain living at the address which has been verified by the court. It is at the afore-mentioned intersection that Mkhulisa life was changed. On the evening of August 7, Mkhulisa arrived at this CBD corner in his silver grey Toyota Yaris, accompanied by his girlfriend. A car guard allegedly requested money from him to keep an eye on the vehicle. Mkhulisa apparently refused and when he returned to his car later on, he allegedly found that it had been broken into and some of his items were missing. He then confronted the car guard who had wanted money from him and demanded answers for what had happened. Mkhulisa then allegedly beat the guard and left him bleeding on the pavement. Police said the missing items from Mkhulisa’s car were two bags which had toiletries, his ID book and matric certificate. Mkhulisa handed himself over to the police after they had visited his home in Alexandra. He is due to return in court on August 31.
