The Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Friday dropped charges against former transport minister Sbu Ndebele. Ndebele was facing charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. He told SowetanLIVE: “Let me reserve [my] comment. This thing has been going on from December 2015 and has been postponed 14 times. Each time you even fly from Australia [where he was high commissioner until October 2017 when he resigned] for a 10-minute [court] session. It has been a very difficult thing [to have happened] to me. I am relieved.” SowetanLIVE is yet to establish whether or not charges against his co-accused have also been withdrawn. The four men - George Mahlalela, Zakhele Thwala, Tebogo Mphuthi and Justin Ncube - were charged with arranging kickbacks in exchange for a five-year contract extension for the management of the Electronic National Traffic Information System.
