New Kaizer Chiefs mentor Giovanni Solinas has insisted that it will take time to put together a team capable of winning trophies. Even though this will not sit well with Amakhosi fans who are desperate for silverware after a three-season barren spell, the Italian said the reality is that it's a process and he's in the first month of his two-year contract. "We are three seasons without a trophy and I know the fans want to win trophies, but we need time. We are fighting to make our fans happy and me, I work hard from the morning to the night every day to make our fans happy," said Solinas following Chiefs' 1-1 draw with Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Stadium at the weekend. "So far I'm happy because the reaction of my boys in the training session is unbelievable. I want to thank my players for the effort they put in every day at training." The 50-year-old was impressed with how his charges played against Sundowns, a team he calls the "Real Madrid or Barcelona" of South Africa. "It was a brilliant game. Both teams played very well. Sundowns is a team that plays beautiful football, offensive football, and me, I like this manner that Sundowns play football," he said. But Chiefs fans will be expecting Solinas to turn their team into a dominant force again, which brings with it some pressure. Solinas, though, is ready for the challenge. "Me, I don't feel under pressure. I'm comfortable. I like the pressure because for me in football pressure is normal. You need to accept and manage the pressure. "Pressure makes me motivated and I know we are a big club," he said. With a point away from home in the bag, Chiefs will now turn their focus to Bidvest Wits, who they host at FNB Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm).
