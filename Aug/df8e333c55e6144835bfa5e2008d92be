Former Kaizer Chiefs defender Fabian McCarthy reckons Amakhosi coach Giovanni Solinas has a point when he cries fatigue and fixture congestion barely four matches into the new campaign. Chiefs are winless after their three opening league matches with a defeat and two draws. In the wake of their 1-1 stalemate against Baroka on Tuesday, Solinas lashed what he termed the tight fixture schedule, saying "these fixtures, this calendar is for the robot, not human beings". Chiefs' only victory so far was their 3-0 thumping of Free State Stars in the MTN8 quarterfinals last weekend. They face Maritzburg United tonight in what will be their third match inside six days. McCarthy who played for Chiefs between 2003 and 2008, shares the same sentiment as Solinas that the PSL calendar is a bit hectic. "I feel the fixture is a bit tight, especially for teams that are also in the MTN8 like Chiefs," McCarthy said. "The travelling also adds to fatigue. Imagine how easier it would have been if Chiefs flew from Polokwane [after the Baroka game] straight to Maritzburg [for today's match against Maritzburg United]. "After [the] Baroka game, they had to start in Gauteng before going to Maritzburg. That's not easy. "I know that in Europe most leagues have even tighter programme but clubs have chartered flights and the travelling is convenient. At least two games in a week are good but not three." The retired defender was optimistic that his former club would redeem themselves soon. He feels it's still early to write Chiefs off. "People are prematurely writing Chiefs off. Once the coach finds his combinations, I think the team will start doing well. I am hoping that they will win the MTN8 to get that positive vibe going forward," noted McCarthy.
