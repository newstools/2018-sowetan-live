President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Dr Silas Ramaite as Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) after the Constitutional Court ruled that the appointment of Shaun Abrahams was invalid. The apex court found that Abrahams was a beneficiary of former president Jacob Zuma's "abuse of power" as he "bought" Abraham's predecessor Mxolisi Nxasana's vacation of the post. In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, the presidency announced that Ramaite, the NPA Deputy National Director responsible for Administration and Office for Witness Protection would act as the prosecuting body's head "While the President is studying the judgment, he is committed to appointing a permanent NDPP well within the 90 days given by the Constitutional Court for such an appointment to be made," Ramaphosa's spokeswoman Khusela Diko said. Ramaite has served as deputy director of the NPA for 15 years. Diko said Ramaite holds the degrees B.Proc (University of Fort Hare), LL.B; LL.M, specializing in Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law and Public International Law and LL.D, specializing in Constitutional Law (University of South Africa). He was admitted as an advocate of the Supreme Court in 1988 and was granted the status of Senior Counsel (SC) in 2001. "President Ramaphosa has wished Dr Ramaite well in his new role and expressed his belief that this week’s court judgment has set the NPA on a path that will restore the integrity of the Authority and build the nation’s confidence in the criminal justice system," Diko said
