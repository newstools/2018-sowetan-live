Former public protector Thuli Madonsela is not interested in taking over as the national director of public prosecutions (NDPP), that’s according to her daughter Wenzile Mandonsela. In an interview with The Citizen last Thursday, Wenzile poured cold water on what many South Africans have been hoping for. “She is one of those people who feels that you must do what you believe God has called you to do,” Wenzile told the publication. Furthermore, she added that while her mother is more than willing to work with the ANC on policies, at this stage in her life Thuli does not want to commit to a position that will prevent her from having an input on a “wider range of things.” “When you’re in a political space [like NPA], you can’t do that.” Thuli recently got engaged to veteran PR consultant Dick Foxton.
