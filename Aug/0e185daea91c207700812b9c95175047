Violence erupted across the capital on Wednesday as MDC supporters took to the streets to protest the results‚ with early results indicating a strong win for the ruling Zanu-PF. At least three people died in the chaos as the military was dispersed to the area. MDC leader Nelson Chamisa claimed victory on the first day of voting. Zanu-PF leader Emmerson Mnangagwa called for calm in the wake of the protests and said he had reached out to Chamisa so the two could work together.
