Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Mongameli Bobani and Port Elizabeth resident Gretchen November on Friday smoked the proverbial peace pipe. “I don’t know what came over me‚ I really did not mean that our new mayor was a baboon‚ I just went with the joke that was going on on the post‚” she said. The mother of four has since deleted her post and inboxed about 14 people to apologise for what she had said.
