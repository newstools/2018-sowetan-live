Zimbabwe’s election commission said it now expected to start announcing presidential election results from Thursday because there were allegations of disputes around tallies that were posted outside polling stations. The main opposition and ZESN, the main domestic election monitor, had on Tuesday said one in five polling stations — more than 2,000 in all — had not physically posted tallies on their doors, as required by law. “It depends with whether those who disagree with something would like to use legal remedies but sometime tomorrow we should be able to advise you what time we can, if any, start announcing the presidential election results,” election commission chair Priscilla Chigumba told reporters. “We are going to defend our vote.” This was the position of hundreds of MDC Alliance supporters that were at the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission offices in Harare. The supporters‚ mainly young people‚ said they would not recognise a vote which did not confirm Nelson Chamisa as president. Among their grievances were the state of the economy and a refusal to be governed by a “military administration” for the next five years. - Additional report by Ray Ndlovu
