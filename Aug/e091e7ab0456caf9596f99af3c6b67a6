US President Donald Trump has called former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman a "dog". He should remember that "a dog's bark is worse than its bite" or in this case their audio recordings. Most dogs are loyal and loving. Farm dogs will work all day for food and water. Guard dogs protect your property and maybe secrets. Guide dogs will lead you to safety. There are however some dogs that will turn on their owners and the results can be tragic. The use of simplistic offensive words shows that the attack lacks substance and accurate details. The lesson in life is a simple familiar one: "If you haven't got something nice to say, don't say anything." Dennis Fitzgerald Melbourne, Australia
