"I cannot sleep at night, I keep seeing her bloody body on the floor and I keep hearing her painfully struggling to scream for me to help her, with her throat slit open wide as blood spilled on the floor," he said. Lifa said with the help of neighbours he rushed his sister to a local clinic; however it was too late. "I feel bitter and defeated as a man for not protecting my only sister", he said fighting back tears. The brother told this publication that the accused had been bothering his sister for two weeks, adding that he had even he warned Ngqeme to let it go and accept that she did not want to be with him. "I did not think he would kill her, I feel like I could have had a sign that she was in danger but I just thought he was a man begging for love and I thought he really loved her", said Lifa. The visibly distraught Lifa said that his sister had taken on the role of a mother when they lost their parents. The matter has been postponed to August 31.
