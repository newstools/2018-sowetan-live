Baroka boss Khurishi Mphahlele has explained how their new sponsor, Global Oil, will ensure things run smoothly even beyond the playing fields. Bakgaga have secured a four-year contract with the petroleum company, which will go a long in easing the financial burden of running the top-flight club. Mphahlele asserted that apart from the financial benefit the Limpopo side will benefit in many other ways. "Our team's performance is an issue, because we have a performance clause. We must perform," said Mphahlele, whose side survived relegation last term, but they have beefed up the squad with about 14 new players. "There's a confidentiality clause in the contract, but there's a reward for the club to perform well." Interestingly, Global Oil's filling stations will serve as a place for the club's supporters to meet and discuss issues pertaining to the club. "We are going to benefit a lot from our relationship with Global," Mphahlele continued. "Most of their [filling stations] are based in the rural areas and Baroka is mostly supported in those areas. Our merchandise will be distributed to all those garages where our supporters will access it easily. So that, to us, is a benefit as a club. "They can also fill their membership [forms] there, form branches and use the garages as their meeting point," he added.
