Last year it was South African Communist Party (SACP) threatening to leave the ANC tripartite alliance because they were unhappy with the former president Jacob Zuma's ways. They threatened to contest the 2019 national elections on their own unless their preferred person for ANC presidency, Cyril Ramaphosa, ascended. They have since changed their mind. Now it is Cosatu threatening to leave the alliance. Each time they don't see eye to eye we hear threats of divorce from the alliance. The point Cosatu is raising is genuine, but threatening to break away each time there is conflict of ideas is an unnecessary discord which the ANC must address. Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said: "We are not going to compromise on our demand for the economy to be restructured towards labour and the poor. The aspirations of the working class have to be reflected in the ANC policies and programmes. If the ANC rejects those aspirations, there will be no need for an alliance." Perhaps Cosatu wants to leave ANC and is using this issue as their ticket out. Ntshalintshali must know better that every negotiation involves compromising and persuasion. Sam Difoe Magana Dennilton
