TV presenter Lungile Radu and his wife Bobo seem to be living their best lives in foreign lands while they holiday!  The couple have shared snaps from New York to  Havana, some of which look like they are shooting a romcom on the set of a movie. From the streets of Brooklyn to the alleys of Havana, these picturesque views gave us goose bumps. A shirtless Lungile soaking up the love from bae Bobo, basking in the culture surrounding them in a bar in Havana. Lungile Radu being cheeky with bae on a balcony somewhere in New York. "Glad to be on this Adventure of Life with you," says Radu in his insta post-ncaaah! Fitting in and adjusting to the culture so well, the pair look like they could be Havana locals. Smiles and sweet nothings on the Lower East side in New York, this moment looked too perfect for words. This close up of them in New York had us all kinds of jelly, how can one couple be so cute together?
