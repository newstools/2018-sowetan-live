A new wave of Botswana footballers have invaded the Absa Premiership in the last month where they will look to stand up and be counted in one of the best leagues on the continent. SA clubs have wasted little time in snapping up no less than four players from the Botswana Premier League. Chippa United snatched Thatoyaone Kgamanyane and Kabelo Seakanyeng from Gaborone United while Highlands Park signed Lesenya Ramoraka (Orapa United) and Baroka roped in Orebotse Mongae (Miscellaneous FC). This group joins other Botswana players already in the PSL - Mogakolodi Ngele (Mamelodi Sundowns), Kabelo Dambe (Bloemfontein Celtic), Mpho Kgaswane (Baroka) and Thabang Sesenyi (Cape Umoya United, formerly Platinum Stars). Zebras legend and former SuperSport United midfielder Dipsy Selolwane hailed these transfers of his countrymen to SA's top flight. "There are five foreign spots allowed by teams, so if they are lucky enough to be signed then they must be good players and those clubs saw something in them," Selolwane told Sowetan. "The opportunities are different, so once they are in there they need to have a plan. They will have to fight for a place in the teams and work harder than everyone else." Selolwane's long career in SA saw him also feature for Santos, Jomo Cosmos, Ajax Cape Town and University of Pretoria. The 40-year-old former national team captain feels the moves would inspire other players in Botswana - a small nation of just 2.2million people - to work harder. "The PSL is a very difficult and complex league to play in. It's a positive for Botswana [players] and to show other young guys that it is possible," he added. "The two leagues are very different and the level is not the same. In SA the training facilities and the following are world- class," he said.
