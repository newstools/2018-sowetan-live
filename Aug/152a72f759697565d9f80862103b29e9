Mpumalanga premier Refilwe Mtsweni has given contractors three weeks to finish fixing the storm damaged houses in Kanyamazane outside Mbombela. Residents have been protesting since Monday last week looting shops belonging to foreign nationals and damaging a shopping complex demanding government to fix their homes. Over 2000 houses mostly RDPs were damaged by hail storm in May and government issued a tender to fix their roofs that were blown away but contractors  pulled out of the job after they were not paid. “We know there are problems in this community. To fix this our contractors are now on site and trying to finish the houses. We have given the contractors three weeks to fix all the roofing part,” Mtsweni said. “As you know the national government is trying do away with asbestos, some of these houses needs to be part of that because some have asbestos roofing." Some community members were not convinced by Mtsweni's latest promises.
