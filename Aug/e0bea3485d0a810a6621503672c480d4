Gauteng department of education started with placement of learners on Friday. This means that all parents who applied for the 2019 admissions for Grade 1 and 8 during the application period which was between April 16 and May 28 will receive offers of placement via SMS. Department spokesman Steve Mabona said parents should visit the department admission website at www.gdeadmissions.gov.za to accept or reject the offer of placement within seven working days. Failure to respond to the offer of placement will result in the forfeiture of the offer to the next applicant on the waiting list. Parents with pending status on the system are requested to be patient as offers will be issued throughout the placement period," Mabona said. Mabona said parents who failed to submit required documents to the schools during the allocated timeframe from April 16 to June 5 are requested to submit documents at district offices from September 10 to September 14. "These applicants and all those who could not be placed by schools due to capacity will be placed by districts. The department plans to have all Grade 1 and 8 learners placed by October 31," Mabona said.
