Kaizer Kganyago will no longer be handling media queries at the public broadcaster. Kganyago, who has been SABC spokesperson for 13 years, is handing over the reigns to Neo Momodu, the new corporate affairs and marketing group executive. Speaking to SowetanLIVE on Friday, communications officer Vuyo Mthembu was adamant Kganyago had not been demoted but rather moved to another role. “Mr Kganyago remains part of communications and will provide support to the group executive of corporate affairs and marketing,” said Mthembu. Kganyago could not be reached for comment at the time of publishing. The SABC said Momodu, who holds LLB (Hons) and boasts more than 20 years working experience, would take up the two roles “with immediate effect”. The position of group executive of corporate affairs was previously held by Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The public broadcaster said: “By putting the role of spokesperson in the [office of] group executive of corporate affairs and marketing, Momodu, the SABC is aligning itself to reflect best business and corporate affairs practices. This is a trend worldwide." SABC group CEO Madoda Mxakwe expressed confidence in Momodu. “I am thrilled to welcome Ms Momodu to the SABC. She joins at a critical stage when we are working towards turning around the organisation," said Mxakwe. “Ms Momodu brings an impressive career in the media and communications sphere, as well as valuable experience with our brands. We are confident that she is equipped to lead this critical division of the organisation. The board and management of the SABC wish Ms Momodu well in executing her duties.”
