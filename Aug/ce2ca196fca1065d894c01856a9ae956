EFF leader Julius Malema has asked former MP Mduduzi Manana, who has been convicted of assaulting women, to be proud of who he is. Speaking at the party's Women's Day celebrations in KZN yesterday, Malema urged Manana to stop being ashamed of who he is. "Be proud of who you are, don't hide who you are. Don't go around beating up people. Mdu Manana is convicted [and] he has resigned from parliament," said Malema. What allegedly triggered his attack on three women last year at a Fourways lounge was a comment by one of the ladies, who labelled him "gay". "Mdu Manana is beating women. If he feels strong, he must come and try that at the EFF offices, we will teach him a lesson ..." "He beats women when they call him gay (Malema said in IsiZulu). He (Manana) says no don’t call me that; as if there is something wrong with being gay.” “I mean if a person comes up to me and says hey Malema you are a man, I’ll say yes I am. If you are gay and they call you gay, you say yes I am because that is who you are. No one has chosen for you, that’s who you are, be proud of who you are. Don’t hide who you are. Manana hung up when contacted for comment yesterday.
