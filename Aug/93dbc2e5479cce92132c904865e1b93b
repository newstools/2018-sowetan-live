SABC viewers will continue to enjoy watching channel 404 on DStv thanks to the new contract. According to SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago, the public broadcaster has signed a new commercial channel supply agreement with DStv. The agreement will allow the SABC News channel 404 and SABC Encore channels to continue to be broadcast on MultiChoice's DStv platform. A previous deal between the two organisations, which was about to lapse, gave MultiChoice access to the SABC’s entire archive. The terms of the new agreement, including its duration, have not been disclosed. The SABC and MultiChoice believe the agreement will give their relationship a new start. SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe said: “The SABC welcomes the new agreement with MultiChoice which will bring certainty to our viewers and our staff. The board and management of the SABC are satisfied that the agreement meets both the commercial and governance needs of the SABC. The SABC looks forward to delivering high-quality channels into the future.” MultiChoice South Africa CEO Calvo Mawela said: “We are pleased to be able to continue to carry these channels on DStv. We have a long-standing relationship with SABC and are happy that we have reached a mutually beneficial agreement. We look forward to continue working with SABC to deliver great entertainment to our customers.”
