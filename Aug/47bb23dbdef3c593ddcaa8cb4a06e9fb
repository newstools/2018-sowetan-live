The SACP has again called on the ANC to consult its alliance partners when making key decisions including  policy direction and deciding on who goes to parliament. ANC's alliance partners - the SACP, Cosatu and Sanco - have previously raised concerns with a situation where the ANC takes key decisions without consulting them. The SACP has proposed in its document that the ANC should  "co-govern" with its alliance partners - with ministers, MPs and other political appointments being made after agreement from all parties. SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande said on Sunday that the SACP wants an inclusive process. "We need alliance partners to have more of a say. We need a reconfigured alliance. "The ANC is aware of what needs to be done if we are to have a united alliance going into the elections. This matter is officially now on the table for discussions. The major item for the upcoming summit will be on this issue of reconfiguration. We must run an inclusive election campaign," Nzimande said during a media briefing on the outcomes of the SACP's three-day central committee meeting in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. Nzimande said the ANC should be able to correct the mistakes it  made in 2016.  SACP first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila said nomination of candidates must be inclusive of the alliance partners. "The message must be sent to the structures of the ANC to consider this matter so we don't build up unnecessary tensions again," Mapaila said. It is unlikely that the ANC would agree to consult its partners on every decisions it wants to make. SACP national spokesperson Alex Mashilo said consultation on policy direction was number one priority. "The rest will come from the policy direction. We must drive a common goal as alliance partners," Mashilo said. The SACP has been arguing for a reconfigured alliance  were all members of the alliance are treated equally and make governance decisions together.
