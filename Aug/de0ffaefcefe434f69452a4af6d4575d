The formal bail application of Malibyane Maoeng, who is facing charges of fraud and being in possession of a stolen vehicle, was postponed for Monday the 24th of August following a brief appearance at the Benoni Magistrates court. This comes after her lawyer Moleba Modikga made a request to the court for a postponement to afford him time for further investigation into Maoeng's citizenship status. Maoeng will now appear before court on the 24th, where more charges could be added. On Friday, Sowetan reported that Yotamu Chigoli, a Malawian national, was the third man to mysteriously die in the presence of 26-year-old Malibyane Maoeng. Chigoli, Dr Sankubele Godfrey Dire and another man only identified as ML Mokgobi all died mysteriously while dating Maoeng. Police are investigating the cause of their deaths. Maoeng was arrested on June 12 at her rented apartment in Benoni, east of Joburg. Chigoli, 28, died after froth came out of his mouth in his rented room in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni last August. Dire, a 62-year-old medic, was found dead with froth coming out of his mouth in a lodge in Sasolburg in June. Mokgobi was discovered in his car at the suspect's residence, early in June, also with froth on the mouth. The 26-year-old allegedly went on a shopping spree with Dire's credit card, buying furniture worth R21000 and making cash withdrawals to the tune of R5000 following his death.
