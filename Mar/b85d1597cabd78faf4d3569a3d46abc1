Properties belonging to the Gupta family have reportedly been raided in India. Journalist Neha Poonia‚ who has covered the Gupta family’s movements in India recently for the SABC‚ tweeted on Tuesday that the properties had been searched by income tax officials. “Income Tax officials in India are also making enquiries about their company Sahara‚” she tweeted‚ adding that properties were being raided in other parts of the country. “Income Tax officials in India are also making enquiries about their company Sahara. Properties of #Gupta family friend - Amar Gupta also raided. I'm being told that the family's properties in other parts of the country are also being raided simultaneously.” The raids are yet to be independently confirmed by authorities.

The Times of India reported that Gupta – who is being sought by the Hawks – had arrived in Dehradun on February 13 after attending a wedding. “The Guptas have a palatial bungalow in Curzon Road in the city‚ where Ajay is believed to have stayed till February 16‚ a day after the news of Zuma’s resignation broke out. During his stay in Dehradun‚ the businessman did not leave the bungalow and remained inside‚” reported The Times of India. This is a developing story.
