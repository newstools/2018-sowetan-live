South African studies conducted in 2016 showed that 60% of primary school children had tooth decay, and 80% of that tooth decay remained untreated. This can have a real impact on the quality of a child’s life. Tooth decay can lead to absences from school and poorer performance. Furthermore, children with recent toothaches are four times less likely to do as well in school as their pain-free peers. Dental products brand Mentadent P is committed to building stronger smiles for South African children. As part of the National Schools Hygiene Programme, in partnership with the Department of Basic Education, Mentadent P is teaching children in schools across South Africa the correct way to brush their teeth every morning and evening. The company aims to reach 1-million South African children by the end of 2019 through the National Schools Hygiene and Sanitation Programme. Mentadent P invites you to show your support on March 20 2018, World Oral Health Day, which is  celebrated globally to promote the benefits of a healthy mouth and the importance of oral hygiene. You can help raise awareness around the importance of oral hygiene and brushing twice a day every day by taking a selfie, posting it on Facebook or Twitter, and tagging your teeth with #EverySmileMatters and #BrushBrush. Mentadent P will then donate a toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste to a child in need for each of these selfies. Share your smile and save someone else’s. This article was paid for by Unilever.
