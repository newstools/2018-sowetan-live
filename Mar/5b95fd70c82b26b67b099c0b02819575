Reports have emerged that a Johannesburg businessman was kidnapped on Saturday. While police are being mum on the incident‚ anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee confirmed that the kidnapping has taken place. “#Kidnappings Viral messages are being circulated. I can confirm that a Johannesburg businessman was kidnapped on Saturday. A few weeks ago‚ a Durban businessman was also taken and he is still missing. @MakeSAsafe” Abramjee tweeted. This publication  understands that the man’s car was found abandoned a few kilometres away from his business. Police refused to disclose information on the case‚ saying it was “sensitive”. In December‚ Limpopo police rescued a Thohoyandou businessman while his alleged kidnapping was in progress. He was not harmed. In another incident‚ Shabir Carrim‚ a prominent Pretoria businessman went missing‚ and was later found after 137 days. Carrim was hospitalised after the ordeal.
