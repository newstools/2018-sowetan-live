Officials have stepped in to help schoolgirls who have appeared on a sex list that has gone viral on social media. But the “Jintoe” list — a derogatory Afrikaans term to describe someone deemed promiscuous — is not new. Lists have been compiled and circulated online for months. Often‚ Facebook users even ask about the release of the latest list. On Tuesday Western Cape Social Development MEC Albert Fritz reacted to the circulation of a list of 31 girls from the Atlantis area. “The children named on the list are all believed to be minors and schoolchildren from various schools in the Atlantis area‚” said Fritz. “Social workers will work with their colleagues from the Western Cape Education Department in order to find all the affected children‚ mostly girls‚ and render urgent trauma counselling and psycho-social support.” Fritz said the lists amounted to cyber bullying and said one of the girls named had allegedly tried to commit suicide. Social workers were in the process of contacting the families of the children. A list of girls from Paarl has recently done the rounds‚ and Eikestad Nuus reported that several girls from prominent schools had been named. One principal said it has been reported to police and the education department. The problem is not limited to the Western Cape. Earlier this month lay counsellor Patricia Arnolds‚ from Port Elizabeth‚ took to Facebook saying such lists had been doing the rounds since 2017 but a “blind eye has been turned”. She wrote: “Meanwhile‚ parents are seeking counselling assistance for their suicidal kids because of this list and the way it’s affecting their child. Please don't brush this off as unimportant. Please address it with your child. “Parents‚ please engage with school governing bodies‚ teachers and principals. I appeal to all kids if you know of the list and the people drafting it please let us know. We will protect your identity at all costs. Let’s stop this in its tracks.”
