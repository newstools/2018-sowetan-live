Three men drowned on Sunday morning in Cape Town when a church sea baptism went wrong. City of Cape Town law enforcement spokesman Wayne Dyason said the incident happened at about 7.45am close to Monwabisi near Khayelitsha. “While conducting the baptism‚ two of the church members got into difficulty in the water.” Dyason said a member of the public went into the water to try to rescue them. All three men drowned. It is unclear if the third man was a church member. “Two bodies are still missing and one was recovered.” Dyason said baptisms are common along the False Bay coastline. “I was in St. James this morning and I saw another baptism being conducted there‚” Dyason said. “It’s not the first time that people drown during these baptisms.” The police and the fire department were currently on the scene‚ he added.
