Controversial Gupta brother Atul Gupta has been given R10-million back after it was frozen in his account following a court application by the Asset Forfeiture Unit. On Friday‚ the High Court in Bloemfontein ruled that the money be unfrozen. This was part of a ruling which also saw the preservation order of R220-million – which the AFU said was the proceeds of crime linked to the Estina dairy farm project in Vrede in the Free State - slashed dramatically to R40-million. This is a developing story.
