When she quit her job as an account consultant to pursue her poultry farming dream, many people advised her not to give up her job. But Nezisa Sogoni, 27, of Butterworth, would not give up on her childhood dream. Three months later, Sogoni does not regret giving up her old job at one of the biggest cellphone network companies. She told the Daily Dispatch that just when she had saved enough money to kick-start her business, she was scammed by an online supplier. However, this did not deter the London School of Business SA and Natgrowth graduate, and she saved up another R25,000 to build her dream. “I always had visions of a chicken farm. One day I woke up and said to myself ‘I am starting no matter how small’.” Now, per cycle, she sells about 100 broilers to re-sellers, from her home in Msobomvu village. It’s hard work though, having to wake up three times a night to care for her chicks. “I started by buying from a farm and reselling and decided to grow them for myself. Since then I never looked back and now I am on my second cycle. “I always believed I am destined for great things that is why I started this business but I believed in God to pave the way for me and my mother has been my pillar.” She said she started the business to create job opportunities, especially for the youth in her community, and to also encourage her peers to venture into farming. “I currently have three youth employees, two of whom are women and from disadvantaged backgrounds,” Sogoni said.
