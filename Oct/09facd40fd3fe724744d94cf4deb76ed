US First Lady Melania Trump arrived in Ghana’s capital Accra on Tuesday on her first solo international trip in Africa, during which she will visit child health facilities, orphanages and meet caregivers. The stop is Trump’s first on a four-country tour that will include visits to Kenya, Malawi and Egypt. The US first lady stepped off an overnight flight from Andrews Airforce Base near Washington and onto a red carpet at Accra’s Kotoka International Airport. She was met by her Ghanaian counterpart Rebecca Akufo-Addo and a group of local schoolchildren in yellow and brown uniforms waving the US stars and stripes and the Ghanaian flag. An AFP reporter at the airport said the former model was smiling and looked relaxed as she was entertained by a troupe of traditional drummers and dancers. The first lady’s office has said the tour will be a “diplomatic and humanitarian visit” that will focus on her #BeBest campaign for “children and their well-being“. It will also “showcase” the work of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), even at a time when her husband’s government is looking to slash US aid across the world. In addition to Ghana, she is due to visit Malawi, Kenya and Egypt before returning to Washington early on October 7.
