The number two hit song of the year Inde by Heavy K, loosely translated "a difficult road ahead", seems to have been a choral ode to Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Keagan Buchanan. This after the player lost R70000 worth of household items on New Year's Day following a house robbery. The midfielder, who has been struggling for game time under coach Steve Komphela, was ushered into the New Year with no furniture. According to a police statement, Buchanan, 27, lost his belongings when thieves broke into his apartment in Noordwyk, Midrand, just after midnight on January 1. Buchanan told police that the suspects gained entry through a bedroom window while he was away. They made off with his two Sony TV sets, an iPad, PlayStation and a MacBook Pro. "On Monday, at about 2.10am, the complainant left the doors and windows closed, all was in order when he left the house. At 4.15am on the same day, the complainant came back and when he opened the door he was surprised to notice that the plasma TV was stolen. "On further investigation, the complainant noticed that the other items were stolen." Midrand police spokesman Mahlaume Mamabolo confirmed a case of house breaking and theft has been opened. "A complex in Noordwyk has been broken into and few items were stolen. So far, no arrests have been made," he said. Buchanan and the club's spokesman, Vina Maphosa, could not be reached for comment. They did not respond to text messages sent to them. Buchanan was not the only player to be robbed during the festive season as Wits midfielder Steven Pienaar had his Ruimsig, Joburg west, house broken into in December. Thieves made off with items worth R200000 - including his sound system, Louis Vuitton bag, his Porsche car key and cellphones.
