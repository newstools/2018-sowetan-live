Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Oupa Manyisa is testament to the refrain "if you can't beat them, join them", after his struggles with Orlando Pirates to beat his current team. The 29-year-old could not be blamed for becoming a turncoat having dominated the tie over the past few seasons with five consecutive league wins, scoring 16 goals. While at Pirates, Manyisa had bruising battles with Sundowns - a fixture that has even upstaged the over-hyped Soweto derby. Manyisa admits that it's far more enjoyable to play in the Sundowns-Pirates match. "People always complain that the Soweto derby is always a draw, but Pirates and Sundowns is an open game. Each team is attacking because both want to score and win," Manyisa said. "When I was at Pirates, I enjoyed playing against Sundowns because there was always a good atmosphere and the stadium is always full." After playing an instrumental role in Sundowns' 3-1 win in the first round, the former Bafana Bafana regular has no problems putting his former employers to the sword once more. He said: "Playing against Pirates does not make it special for me. "Football is my job so I have to go there [and] enjoy myself and make sure I help my team. "There is nothing to be concerned about Pirates because I am no longer there; I have a new home now." The clash always delivers the goods by way of exhilaration, but Bucs go into the match having lost all their past five meetings with Downs.
