Indian national Chandrama Prasad, who scored R465000 as project coordinator of the controversial Free State dairy farm project, is set to leave the country today. Prasad - whom Sowetan met at his Vrede home yesterday - claimed he was only in the country to upgrade security at his house and confirmed he had once worked at the project. He said he lived in India full-time but confirmed that he owned the property. He, however, refused to respond to questions about the project. "I'm no longer there [dairy farm], I left long time ago. I was only there at the beginning. "I'm from India, I'm here to sort out security here, I'm flying back to India tomorrow [today]." Prasad is among 16 individuals and companies affected by the asset forfeiture unit's preservation order. Prasad's residential address, according to a Free State High Court preservation order obtained by the asset forfeiture unit last Thursday, was also used by little-known company Vargafield that scored R16.4-million from the project. When Prasad was asked about Vargafield, he responded: "I don't know it." Sowetan has established that Vargafield is currently undergoing voluntary liquidation. The company was registered in 2012 and scored more than R16.4-million in one year of operating.
