Joyous Celebration singer Lynnzay Baatjies is singingÂ  the blues after she was arrested for allegedly stealing underwear. The songstress was arrested at Woolworths in Rosebank, Joburg, after she was allegedly caught in possession of goods she did not pay for on December 8. She was detained at the Rosebank police station and was later released on R500 bail, helping her to be on time for the music group's live DVD recording that took place the following day. Baatjies appeared in the Hillbrow Magistrate's Court this week where she pleaded not guilty. She asked for the matter to be postponed because her lawyer was not able to make it to court with her. Dressed in a floral gown and black leggings, Baatjies evaded photographers as she rushed into an awaiting car parked opposite the court. According to a police statement, the singer was found in possession of slippers, a bra and panties amounting to more than R600. "When she exited the shop, she was searched by a security guard and failed to produce the slip for the items that were found in her bag," stated the statement. According to police sources at Rosebank police station where she was detained, she begged police officers to release her because she was going to perform at the live recording of Joyous Celebration 22, which took place in Sandton on December 9. When contacted for comment, Baatjies said she did not want to talk about her arrest and court appearance. "Where did you get my numbers from? I really don't want to talk about it ma'am," she said before hanging up. Joyous Celebration co-founder Lindelani Mkhize was shocked to learn about the matter because he was not aware of the alleged crime. "I will have to find out if this is true. I find it very hard to believe because we performed ... She was fine and gave the best performance," he said. He said if it was true, they would assist her where possible because she is part of their family.
