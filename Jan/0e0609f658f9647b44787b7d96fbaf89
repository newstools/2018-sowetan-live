"This crisis has major implications for our sector because it could result in health complications," Motshekga said. She said were working together with the provincial government to prepare for the eventuality. "The provincial government has assessed about 400 schools with existing boreholes, some of which need fixing to ensure water for hygiene and fire safety," Motshekga said.

They are also well placed to educate families about water saving via the children," Motshekga said. mahopoz@sowetan.co.za
