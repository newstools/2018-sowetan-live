Basic Education minister Angie Motshekga on Monday called for the protests to stop. “So we are appealing to everybody to say there is a process that is quite clear. If they are unhappy about the court decision‚ then they must be friends of the court‚ but they must not bring the battle to the school," Motshekga said during a visit to the school.
