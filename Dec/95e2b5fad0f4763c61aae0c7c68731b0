Former Springbok hooker Naka Drotské suffered from "massive bleeding" that left him in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Barbara Steenkamp, spokesperson for Mediclinic Bloemfontein, said Drotské was admitted to the hospital late on Tuesday after his condition took a turn for the worse. He was admitted to intensive care in a critical condition. "He presented with massive internal bleeding which led to hemorrhagic shock that required a blood transfusion," she said in a statement. "Mr Drotské also suffers from adult respiratory distress syndrome with a lung infection and multi-organ dysfunction." Drotské's wife Marzanne said a few days ago that the former coach of Super Rugby side the Cheetahs was feeling "100%, apart from low blood pressure". At the time, he was recovering from being shot during a robbery at his brother’s home near Pretoria. Steenkamp said Drotskè was expected to be placed on ventilation and remain sedated for a few days. She said the internal bleeding had stopped. The former Springbok played 26 tests between 1993 and 1999. He played one game during the 1995 World Cup in SA.
