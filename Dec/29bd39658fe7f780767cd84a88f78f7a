EFF leader Julius Malema is expected to appear in the North Gauteng High Court on Wednesday in a case related to his call on supporters to invade vacant land. Malema has been charged with violating the Riotous Assemblies Act but is challenging the constitutionality of the act and argues that the state is using apartheid-era legislation to charge him.
