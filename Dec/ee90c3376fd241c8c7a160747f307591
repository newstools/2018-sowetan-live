SAâ€™s medicines regulator has banned the use of medicines containing sodium valproate during pregnancy unless no other treatment is available, as they significantly increase the risk of severe birth defects and developmental problems. Valproate is used for treating epilepsy and bipolar disorder, as well as migraines. The SA  Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra) issued a statement on Friday saying women of child-bearing age should not be started on valproate unless no other effective treatment is available, and those  already taking the drug should be made aware of the risks and take precautions to avoid falling pregnant. kahnt@businesslive.co.za
