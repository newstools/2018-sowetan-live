Donald Trump again will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos next month, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday. "The president will attend as he did last year," said Sanders, who added that Trump's daughter Ivanka will also participate as part of the US delegation to the annual talks held at a Swiss ski resort.
