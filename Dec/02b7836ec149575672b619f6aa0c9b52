A Rwandan court Thursday found dissident politician Diane Rwigara not guilty of forgery and inciting insurrection, charges that saw her imprisoned for over a year and highlighted a crackdown on opposition in the country. "All charges... have been dropped. The court finds that the prosecution charges were baseless," a panel of three judges said in the ruling.
