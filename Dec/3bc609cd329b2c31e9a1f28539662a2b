An 18-year-old teen who died after falling from the stands in Mmabatho Stadium in Mahikeng during the Maftown Heights music festival at the weekend has been identified as Lesego Khukhwane. Her family in Montshioa - just 6km down the road from the stadium - said they had heard over social media and on radio that there was a young woman who died at the festival but never thought it was their daughter. Lesego’s uncle Kalaemang Khukhwane said after she did not return home two days after the festival he delegated family members to go on a search for his niece. “When they arrived at the government mortuary, they found her body there. That was when we learnt that the girl who had died is actually my niece,” he said. “I was the last person [in the family] to see her. I gave her R50 and took her to the bus station; her passing has really touched me.” Khukhwane added that he had no problem with Lesego attending the music show at the stadium as she "is a good child and had finished writing her matric”. He said Lesego had wanted to study agricultural sciences next year. “She won't be able to see her matric results, she won’t be able to see her dream coming true, but we have to accept that these things happen.” Lerato Khukhwane, Lerato's aunt, said the family was awaiting postmortem result to know the exact cause of her death. “The information we received was that she fell from the stairs, hit something and died on the spot,” she said. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the woman was treated by a doctor and paramedics but died at the scene. “She was certified dead after she allegedly fell from the stadium stand,” he said.
