At the Makangwane Secondary School in Bochum‚ Limpopo‚ there are Grade 12 pupils who had allegedly not done any work by the end of the first term. “Earlier this year when applying at university‚ they asked for my March 2018 results‚ but I gave them my 2016 report because we didn’t do any work in March‚” said one learner‚ Petronella Hlako. According to Hlako‚ they spent their time sitting outside‚ under trees‚ because their classrooms were falling apart. At one point‚ a snake was found slithering in a dilapidated classroom. Her story was documented by public law interest group Section 27 in a video posted on social media. In it‚ Hlako told of the difficulties they had studying under trees‚ especially in wet and windy conditions. “The department doesn’t care about us‚ even though they know that our parents have had to take us out of the classrooms. From my perspective‚ they don’t care. It’s as though they don’t care about us or our future‚” Hlako said. The Limpopo Education Department on Wednesday‚ however‚ said it had tried to attend to the situation for quite a while. “The school is a small school. It cannot exist on its own‚” said Sam Makondo‚ provincial department spokesman‚ who explained that the school had only 109 pupils. Department policies say a school needs a minimum of 200 learners to be functional. “Parents at the school do not want to be moved to a new school. They are denying that the school be closed even though we have provided an alternative‚” he said. Makondo alleged that each time they moved the children to neighbouring schools with extra classrooms‚ the parents fetched the children. “They are forcing the hands of the department [into renovating and keeping the school open]‚” said Makondo. “But the school cannot be renovated‚” he said. Makondo said the district was doing all it could to ensure that the students‚ especially the matriculants‚ were not falling behind.
