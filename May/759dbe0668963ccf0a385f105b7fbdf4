I was saddened by  the deaths of  miners at the Sibanye Stilwater mine, Drie-fontein, Carltonville after a reported rockfall. I  do understand we can't avoid natural disasters from happening, but how safe are our miners? Mining bosses make lots of money and neglect people's safety even though working underground is  dangerous. But crying over spilt milk won't help us. Putting safety at mines first will.
