Talk about lucky. A stunned Sydney man who was celebrating an Australian lottery windfall could not believe it when he won again less than a week later. The unidentified man, in his 40s and from the suburb of Bondi, picked up Aus$1,020,487 (R9.2 million) on Monday last week and then scooped another Aus$1,457,834 (R14-million) on Saturday. "I just thought this is too good to be true," he told NSW Lotteries Monday after being informed of his good fortune. "The chances of winning twice in such a short period of time must be non-existent. I wish I had some advice to others on how to win the lottery, but I don't." Asked what he would do with the cash, he said: "I'm not going to be stupid with it." He plans to invest in some Sydney real estate, buy a new car and "a holiday to Honolulu goes without saying". Lottery organisers could not estimate the likelihood of winning twice in a week, but the odds of winning once are one in 1.845 million. "We don't know of anyone else who has won twice in a week," NSW Lotteries spokesman Matt Hart told AFP. "We have had people win twice in their lifetime, but not twice in a week. It is very unusual and unique." Lotteries are hugely popular in Australia, with various government-owned and private-sector operators. The biggest recent winner was a man from Victoria state who woke up Aus$55 million richer in January.
