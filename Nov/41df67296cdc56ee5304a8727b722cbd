Tsakane Stadium may be the venue for the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) festival this weekend. But the fixture between leaders Cape Town City and defending champions Golden Arrows at Princess Magogo Stadium on Sunday is definitely the reserve league's main attraction of the week. After nine matches, City are top of the table on 22 points. On the other hand, Arrows are high in confidence after winning their last two matches against other title contenders AmaZulu and Bloemfontein Celtic, who are second and third on the log, respectively. "Arrows are in form and they are the defending champs. so, we expect a tough one. The fact that we are going to them makes it even trickier," said City coach Richard Lovell, who joined the Cape side in July. "Obviously, beating the champs can boost our confidence. Our aim is to finish the year still on top. But I do not want to put my players under pressure. We do not really look at the table but we concentrate on the next match.'' The City Diski tactician has refused to tip any of his players for first team promotion, hinting that would divide his troops. "I cannot speak about individuals. It would be unfair to single out individuals because we fight as a team and that has been our strength. I am lucky to work with such bunch of committed youngsters, the future looks bright for them," stated Lovell. The 43-year-old youth mentor also credited first team coach Benni McCarthy for constantly showing interest in the club's MDC side, saying they share a great working relationship. "Benni always watches us play when he's not busy. We have a wonderful relationship, which I think will benefit the team. The players are happy to see him showing love to what they do,'' said the Johannesburg-born Lovell.
