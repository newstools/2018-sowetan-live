If she had not passed away fourteen years ago, she would have been turning 54 years old. The bold and fearless MaBrrr disrupted the narrative as much as she wrote it. Watching her celebrity journey was always a joy ride: you never knew what was coming next. The controversies, the gender fluidity, and the rock-star lifestyle inspired generations of fans who still look to her as a legend. MaBrrr found freedom to express herself as a mother, a woman, and an artist. Whether it’s Zola Budd, Vulindlela, or Weekend Special, everyone has that one song that takes you Higher and Higher.
