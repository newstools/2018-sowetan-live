The father of the late Hip Hop star Jabulani 'HHP' Tsambo has defiantly declared that he is not bothered by an application to interdict the funeral of his son. He said funeral arrangements for the rapper's burial were forging ahead. This comes after it emerged that the rapper's "customary" wife Lerato Sengadi filed an application with the South Gauteng High Court on Tuesday to stop the funeral scheduled for Saturday. However, HHP's father Robert Tsambo told Sowetan this morning ahead of a memorial service in Mahikeng that the funeral will go ahead as planned on Saturday. The relationship between the Tsambo family and Sengadi has soured after the family's decision to not recognise Sengadi as the late rapper’s wife. Tsambo said the family attorneys were handling the court matter. “I have made it clear to her that she is not welcome at the funeral,” he said. “We are about to enter into a meeting with a funeral parlour to confirm the funeral arrangements for Saturday.” The MEC for the department of Arts and Culture Otlametse Mochari is expected to speak at the funeral. The Mmabatho Convention centre is currently filled to capacity with friends, fans and community members at large who have come to pay tribute to the rapper at the memorial service in Mahikeng.
