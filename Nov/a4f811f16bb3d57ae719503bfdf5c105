Fashionistas, bloggers, influencers and celebrities flocked to the SA Style Awards in Joburg last night. Let's take a look at the hits and misses from the event: K Naomi TV presenter and model K Naomi sparkled in her glittery suit by South African fashion label Bride's Palace. Zuraida Jardine A step up from last year, Zuraida Jardine looked breathtaking in this delicate sheer lace gown. Something out of a fairy tale we'd say! Basetsana Kumalo Gert Johan Coetzee outdid himself with this one! The beautiful Basetsana Kumalo kept it classy with this Wakanda inspired look. Sarah Langa We were not loving those ruffles blogger Sarah Langa showed up in last night. They reminded us of our grandmother's curtains from back in the day. DJ Zinhle We're not too sure what DJ Zinhle was trying with this look. Is she a preppy school girl or a Japanese anime character? Tamara Dey Singer Tamara Dey clearly missed the brief about the 'Style Awards'. She just looked like a hot mess!
