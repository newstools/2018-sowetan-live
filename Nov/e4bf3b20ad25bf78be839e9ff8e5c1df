It was the annual Victoria's Secret fashion show last night in New York City and it had a different mood this year as iconic angel Adriana Lima walked her last show. It was an emotional time as tears flowed during her last stride on the runway where she received a standing ovation. The angel represented the brand for 20 years with her debut back in 1999. She became an angel the next year. She was the longest serving angel in the history of the brand to hit the catwalk. While Adriana was the main event last night, there were a few other models who made waves for Victoria's Secret this year. Vitiligo model Winnie Harlow and Autralia's Next Top Model runner upÂ Nyadak "Duckie" Thot made their debuts this year. The brand certainly did not disappoint with what also appeared to be a more diverse showing in terms of models. Let's take a look at our 5 favourite looks from the show:
