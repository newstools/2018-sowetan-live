For all their recent dominance over Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates have never progressed to the next stage of the Telkom Knockout at Amakhosi's expense. From the days when the tournament - known elsewhere in the world as the League Cup - was called the Datsun Challenge through to the Coca-Cola Cup, Amakhosi have always had the upper hand in the 36-year history of the competition. Bucs did beat Amakhosi 1-0 in the 1998/99 edition, but it was a two-legged clash, with Chiefs having wrapped up the first leg 3-1 to win 3-2 on aggregate.
