Baroka FC have parted ways with their technical director Doctor Khumalo. The club is expected to issue a statement later on Thursday afternoon confirming Khumalo’s departure. The Kaizer Chiefs legend joined Bakgaga in August last year and even though Baroka’s new coach Wedson Nyirenda expressed a desire to work with Khumalo early this week‚ the latter has decided to move on. Khumalo has been linked with a return to Chiefs in an assistant coaching capacity.
