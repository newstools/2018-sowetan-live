Kaizer Chiefs players would be relishing the opportunity to play alongside new signing Khama Billiat, but would they complement him? A lot will be expected from Amakhosi's new number 11, who can play at least three roles - as a winger, behind the strikers or as a false nine. Billiat has proven deadly in any attacking position he's been assigned to from his days at Ajax Cape Town (2010-2013) and Mamelodi Sundowns (2013-2018). What Billiat brings to Chiefs are goals and assists. Last season alone he contributed nine strikes and a further eight assists in 21 appearances despite being in and out of the team due to injuries. His arrival means he reunites with Leonardo Castro. Together with Keegan Dolly, they formed a deadly combination dubbed the "CBD" at Sundowns two seasons ago. In a 4-3-2-1 formation, Billiat could play behind Castro at Chiefs, but it remains to be seen what system the new coach would deploy. Former coach Steve Komphela always insisted he was playing a 4-3-3 system. What is not in doubt is that the Zimbabwean's ability to play many attacking roles could benefit Chiefs hugely and the club's former striker, Pollen "Trompies" Ndlanya, concurs. "Give him a free role," Ndlanya asserted. "To have a player like Khama is a blessing, because you can play him all over." "But if I was the coach, I would give him the freedom and not restrict him." Perhaps what could aid Billiat's game is the backing of the Amakhosi faithful, who are already delighted with his acquisition. "Chiefs have a lot of supporters and, once he plays those one-twos or take a shot at goal, the supporters will be behind him," Ndlanya added. Billiat's Premiership statistics speak volumes - 68 goals in 206 appearances. If he carries on in this vein, the attacking midfielder would be a hit at Chiefs.
