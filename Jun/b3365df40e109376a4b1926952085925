Maritzburg United have extended the contracts of strikers Andrea Fileccia‚ Mohau Mokate and flying fullback Pogisho Sanoka but captain Bevan Fransman has been let go. The 34-year-old former international defender skippered Maritzburg to a club-high fourth place finish in the Absa Premiership plus a place in the Nedbank Cup final this season but his contract was not renewed. Newly promoted Highlands Park have wasted no time in snatching him up and Fransman has signed a two-year contract with the Johannesburg-based outfit. A statement from him said: “I have spent a large portion of my career playing in Gauteng. "I have a home and family here and when this opportunity arose for me to join such an established and ambitious club like Highlands Park I was up for the challenge. "I am looking forward to this new chapter in my career and can’t wait for the season to begin.” Fileccia has had a one-year extension in his contract activated by the club‚ who left it until the end of the month to tell the Belgian-born striker they wanted him for another season. He has become something of a fan favourite at the Harry Gwala Stadium. Mokate and Sanoko have been given contract extensions by the club‚ officials said on Tuesday.
