The inaugural Shell Helix Cup clash between Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns next month will be a dress rehearsal for the two powerhouses' league encounter a couple of weeks later. Following the pre-season friendly at FNB Stadium on July 21, Amakhosi and the reigning PSL champions will get down to serious business when they meet again at Loftus Stadium on August 4 (3pm). This was confirmed in the provisional PSL fixture list seen by Sowetan yesterday. The category A game is one of the opening league fixtures for the 2018/19 Absa Premiership campaign. Bidvest Wits will officially lift the curtain on the new season when they host Free State Stars at Bidvest Stadium on August 3. PSL newcomers Black Leopards and Polokwane City are set for a duel in the Limpopo derby at Thohoyandou Stadium, also in the first week of the season. This means that the Venda venue now meets the PSL's standards after some minor renovations recently. Orlando Pirates, who finished second last season, will be at home against newly promoted side Highlands Park at Orlando Stadium. The MTN8 will kick off on August 11, followed by a Fifa international break early in September, before the Telkom Knockout takes centre stage late in October. The first Soweto derby of the season between Chiefs and Pirates is set for October 27 at Orlando Stadium, but it will probably be moved to FNB Stadium, which usually hosts this big clash.
