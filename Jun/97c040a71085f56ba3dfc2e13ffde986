For the first time‚ Cyril Ramaphosa’s face will appear on the ballot paper in next year’s elections. This is likely to be a major factor in how people vote‚ or whether they vote at all. Ramaphosa’s election as ANC leader has been a major game changer in South African politics since he has the potential to arrest the governing party’s downward trend at the polls. There remains a lot of goodwill around his presidency and many people are willing him to succeed. He seems to have emptied out his bag of initial deliverables with his clean-up campaign in the state and removal of a number of compromised people in senior positions. But there is a long way to go‚ including removing dead wood from his cabinet and cleaning up the National Prosecuting Authority.
