Power utility, Eskom, has put a 6.2% final wage increase offer on the table during the second day of negotiations in Woodmead, Johannesburg. Sowetan has reliably learnt that Eskom negotiators have "threatened" that if unions do not accept this offer, the state owned entity would have no choice but to revert to its initial offer of 4.7%. Unions are jointly demanding a 9% salary increase offer and they've also given Eskom ideas on how to improve its balance sheet to afford what unions demand. "They're offering 6.2% for 2018 and 6.6% for next year... and they're threatening us to either take this offer or they'll revert back to 4.7%," the insider said. Yesterday, unions rejected a 5% revised salary increase offer which they labelled a joke. Â  Unions are now expected to caucus and discuss this offer before presenting a consolidated response later today. The latest negotiations are scheduled to take three days, with an agreement expected to be signed tomorrow during the last day. If the ongoing negotiations fail to bring about an agreement, the dispute would then be escalated to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).
