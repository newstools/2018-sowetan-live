Serena Williams said she wants to make her daughter proud after fighting back to reach the French Open third round on Thursday. The 36-year-old American came from a set and break down to defeat Australia’s Ashleigh Barty 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. The three-time champion and former world number one, dressed again in her all-black catsuit, is playing her first Slam since winning the 2017 Australian Open while two months pregnant. However, her stay in Paris almost proved short-lived until she summoned the same fighting spirit which helped her conquer life-threatening blood clots after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian in September. “It’s just incredible,” said Williams. “I am so happy to be back here. I lost the first set and thought I must try harder, I must try harder — and then Serena came out. “I will be back tomorrow to play doubles with Venus. I don’t mind playing singles and doubles — I will fight my heart out.” Williams said her daughter inspires her to keep winning as she targets Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 majors. “This is my first Grand Slam back and I want to the best that I can. “I want to be able to one day tell my daughter that I tried my best.” Williams will face Germany’s Julia Goerges for a place in the last 16 on Saturday. If she gets past that challenge, she could face old rival Maria Sharapova for a place in the quarter-finals. Williams again played in her striking all-black catsuit which has raised some questions over its legality. But the American insisted it was crucial to help prevent a return of life-threatening blood clots. “I definitely thought there would be a lot of reactions over the outfit,” she said. “It’s not a typical outfit. But what’s typical, you know? Who makes the rules? “I feel like in 2018 the world’s different. I t’s important to be yourself and to bend things and to try something new and to try something fresh. “However, my outfit is actually functional for me, because I had a lot of health issues.” Williams had cruised through her opening round match against Kristyna Pliskova in what was a record 317th win at the Slams. But Thursday was a tougher proposition for the American who was playing just her sixth match of 2018. Barty wrapped up the first set when the former world number one netted a weary-looking forehand, the 12th unforced error of the opener. Williams hit just three winners while 22-year-old Barty could afford to bide her time, just two winners and four unforced errors coming from her side. She was a break down again after dropping serve in the opening game of the second set. But just as the half-full crowd, enjoying the late evening sunshine on Court Philippe Chatrier anticipated a quick kill, Williams came storming back, reeling off four straight games for 4-1. A fifth ace of the contest won her the set. A break in the third game of the decider proved crucial and Williams claimed victory on a second match point with a sweeping, running forehand.
