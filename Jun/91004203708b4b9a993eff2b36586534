Free State Stars general manager Rantsi Mokoena insists there is nothing untoward about coach Luc Eymael's absence from the team's pre-season camp. The Belgian tactician is yet to return to the country from holiday despite the players having started training on Monday. Despite the coach still being in Europe, an odd statement on the club's website earlier in the week read: "Coach Luc Eymael, his staff and the players were in good spirits after returning from their end-of-season break." Mokoena told Sowetan yesterday that Eymael would be back in the country today or tomorrow. Eymael has been the subject of speculation in recent months with reports linking him with other PSL clubs. Mokoena said the club had still not had an offer to buy out the Ea Lla Koto coach from the one year remaining on his contract. "It has always been rumours and [we] have only read about them [in the media]. We have a coach; we're happy that he has delivered on his mandate. We cannot focus if he is wanted or whatever," he said. In the previous campaign, Stars had their best season in decades after a sixth-place finish in the Premiership and winning the Nedbank Cup. The Bethlehem-based club will compete in the CAF Confederation Cup in the coming season after winning the R7-million cup last month. Mokoena said Stars' management were finalising new signings and will make an announcement in the coming days. "Competing in CAF does not mean we need a bigger squad. There is not much to do other than preparing thoroughly. "We have already made some signings and we will make an announcement once we have completed them. So far though, I am happy with the squad we have," he added.
