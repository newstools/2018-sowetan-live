New Polokwane City coach Jozef Vukusic has started what could be a long journey with Rise and Shine, at least in terms of his contract. The Slovakian was unveiled in Polokwane yesterday. Vukusic takes over from Bernard Molekwa, who was head coach during the entire 2017/18 PSL campaign, a season in which City survived relegation to finish 12th. Molekwa has been retained as assistant coach. Vukusic, 54, is not new to SA football as he was coach of National First Division side FC Cape Town in 2010. He stayed on for two-and-a-half years before returning home. "I've signed a four-year contract," Vukusic said yesterday. "What I want from every player in this team is to play to their full potential. I'm sure if they achieve that, then we will have good results," said the coach, who also had stints in Libya, Kazakhstan and Latvia since 2003. Vukusic holds a Uefa Pro Licence which he obtained through the German Football Association and his coaching philosophy is derived from the 2014 World Cup winners. "I did my licence in Germany and, as you know, in Germany they base their football on discipline, responsibility and organisation. But my philosophy is to play balanced football defensively and offensively." City also confirmed the signing of seven new players yesterday, including former Free State Stars striker Mohammed Anas. Others are Lehlohonolo Ledwaba from ABC Motsepe League side Buya Msuthu, Themba Chauke (Dolphins), Tebogo Kalaka, Bongani Manavhela (both Tshakhuma), Msekeli Mvalo (Cape Town All Stars) and Khayalethu Mjoli (Uthongathi). Polokwane will open their 2018/19 campaign against neighbours Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on August 4.
