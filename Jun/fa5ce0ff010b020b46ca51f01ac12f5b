Well over 30 games into the World Cup in Russia and goals have been a certainty in all the matches played so far. Prior to yesterday's fixtures there had been no goalless draws until France and Denmark produced the first scoreless game of the tournament. Every game has guaranteed at least a goal, with an average of 2.7 goals scored already. And there have been some close moments in the clashes too where a goal had to come in the final minutes to avoid a goalless draw. In Iran's 1-0 win over Morocco in the first few days of the competition, it took an own goal from Aziz Bouhaddouz to break the deadlock in injury time, while Uruguay edged Egypt with a Jose Gimenez strike in the 89th minute. There have been two games so far that have produced seven goals in each. England hammered Panama 6-1 while Belgium thrashed Tunisia 5-2 last week. The leading goal scorers at the tournament so far are Harry Kane with five goals for England. Romelu Lukaku of Belgium and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo both have scored four goals already. Kane and Ronaldo were the only players to have scored a hat-trick in the tournament at the time of going to print. The Tottenham Hotspur sharpshooter is expected to lead the England attack against Belgium in their final group fixture tomorrow night. Lukaku is doubtful for the fixture. But while the goals have been flowing in Russia, the tournament is still a long way off from matching the record for most goals on average - the 1954 edition in Switzerland which produced an average 5.38 goals. However, the World Cup back then had only 16 nations participating with only 26 games overall, but still a total of 140 goals were scored.
