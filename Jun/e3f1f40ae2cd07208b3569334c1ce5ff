The president of the ANC and the country has begun making serious blunders. His warm reception from people, known as "Ramaphoria", is losing steam as a result of him following the route of his predecessor Jacob Zuma of loving the ANC at the expense of the country. SA has entered a political space where everyone wants to see how the ANC cleanses itself from Zuma's legacy. The struggling economy and political calamities facing the ANC and its alliance partners centre around Zuma. South Africans are still guessing or making their own theories on how one of the Guptas and Duduzane Zuma fled while our country appears to be losing an appetite to hunt them. Going to 2019 elections with everyone who stole from the public purse walking free may be suicidal to the ANC. The anger of the public having to pay higher electricity and food prices because of consequences created by corruption will shape the elections. With spineless and dodgy characters in strategic positions such as David Mabuza, Pule Mabe and Ace Magashule and his questionable cabinet, Ramaphosa's emphasis on unity not guided by principle aligned to his new dawn is meaningless, because it appears he is sacrificing the country's democracy to accommodate Zuma's loyalists in particular.
