Senegal fans have won the hearts of millions of people around the world after a video of them cleaning up a section of the stadium emerged following their 2-1 2018 World Cup opener over Poland at the Spartak Stadium on Monday. Instead of bursting into wild celebrations as the Teranga Lions became the first African side to win a match in Russiaâ€š the fans stayed back to pack their litter in plastic bags in a video clip that has since gone viral. On Tuesday Japanese fans were also filmed cleaning the stadium after their 2-1 win over Colombia and there is hope that fans of the other teams will follow suit for the remainder of the event.
