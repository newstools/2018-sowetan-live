Uruguay beat Egypt 1-0 in Yekaterinburg on Friday, with Jose Gimenez heading the winner in the closing minutes as the South Americans exerted pressure late on following an uneventful match. Egypt’s Mohamed Salah was kept on the bench throughout the Group A encounter, which was uneventful before a late surge from Uruguay culminated in Gimenez’s 89th-minute winner.
